The average intake of nut products was 5 g/p/d contributing with 1.4% of energy in the national dietary 
survey among adults 2010 using 2x24h recall. 
The proportion of adults reporting to consume unsalted nuts or nut mixes once a week or more 
increased from 9 til 12% during 2009-2013 according to Norwegian Eating Facts. In 2013 the 
proportion consuming unsalted nuts never or rarely was 34% and daily 2%. 
The proportion that ate salted peanuts at least weekly increased from 8 to 9% during 2009-2013. In 
2013 the proportion consuming salted peanuts never or rarely was 32%. 
Conclusions: The consumption of nuts is increasing, but it is far from recommended levels. A large 
proportion of the population rarely consumes nuts.

Physical activity improves the regulation of glucose homeostasis in both type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
patients and healthy individuals, but the effect on pancreatic β cell function is unknown. We 
investigated glycaemic control, pancreatic function and total fat mass before and after 8 weeks of low 
volume high intensity interval training (HIIT) on cycle ergometer in T2D patients and matched healthy 
control individuals. Study design/method: Elderly (56 yrs±2), non-active T2D patients (n=10) and 
matched (52 yrs±2) healthy controls (CON) (n=13) exercised 3 times (10×60 sec. HIIT) a week over 
an 8 week period on a cycle ergometer. Participants underwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test 
(OGTT). On a separate day, resting blood pressure measurement was conducted followed by an 
incremental maximal oxygen uptake (V̇ O2max) cycle ergometer test. Finally, a whole body dual X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) was performed. After 8 weeks of training, the same measurements were 
performed. Results: glycaemic control as determined by fasting venous glucose concentration, end 
point 2-hour OGTT and glycosylated haemoglobin was significantly reduced (p<0.05). Pancreatic 
homeostasis as determined by homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and 
HOMA β cell function (HOMA-%β) were both reduced significantly (p<0.05). Whole body insulin 
sensitivity as determined by the disposition index (DI) was significantly increased (p<0.05). During 
OGTT, the glucose continuum was significantly reduced at -15, 15 and 120 min (p<0.05) and at -10 
and 0 min (p<0.01) with an additional improvement (p<0.05) of its 1st phase (30 min) AUC. Significant 
abdominal fat mass losses were seen in both groups (T2D: p<0.01 and CON: p<0.05) corresponding 
to a percentage change of -17.84 %±5.02 and -9.66 %±3.07, respectively.  
Conclusion: These results demonstrate that HIIT improves overall glycaemic control and pancreatic β 
cell function in T2D patients. Additionally, both groups experienced abdominal fat mass losses. These 
findings demonstrate that HIIT is a health beneficial exercise strategy in T2D patients.
