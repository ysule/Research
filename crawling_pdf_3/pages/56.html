<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Objective: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">Controversy still remains about the safety and efficacy of a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) in 
<br>the longer term management of type 2 diabetes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-
<br>analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the effect of a LCD, containing ≤40 
<br>energy percent (E%) from carbohydrates, compared with a higher carbohydrate diet (&gt;40 E%), on 
<br>weight management, metabolic control and compliance in adults with type 2 diabetes. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Methods:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENRTRAL, CINAHL, Food Science Source and 
<br>SweMed+ (through November, 2013) for relevant trials of ≥3 months duration. Two independent 
<br>reviewers assessed the validity of studies using Cochrane Collaborations Risk of Bias Tool. The 
<br>GRADE approach was utilised to assess the quality of evidence for primary outcomes. Pooled effects 
<br>were calculated by random effects meta-analyses and expressed as mean differences (MD) for 
<br>continues outcomes, and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. Statistical heterogeneity was 
<br>quantified by I</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:6px">2</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Results:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Eighteen RCTs, with a total of 1832 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Compared to the 
<br>control diet, no significant effect was found in favour of the LCD on weight management (weight loss: 
<br>MD -0.29 kg; 95% CI -1.17, 0.58) or HbA1c (MD -0.04%; 95% CI -0.14, 0.06). Furthermore, no 
<br>significant difference was observed for blood concentrations of total-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, 
<br>triacylglycerol, or blood pressure. Compliance, as measured by attrition rates, showed a small but 
<br>non-significant effect in favour of the control diet (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.87, 1.21). 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Conclusions:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> The findings from this meta-analysis suggest that LCDs may be an option in the long 
<br>term management of type 2 diabetes but they are not superior to diets with a higher carbohydrate
