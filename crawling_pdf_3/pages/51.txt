Objective: There is growing endorsement for the benefits of lowering acute post-prandial glucose 
(PPG) and insulin (PPI) responses to carbohydrate-rich staples. This work describes the selection and 
effects of incorporating viscous fibres and an alternative starch source into the wheat-based flour 
(‘atta’) used for making flatbreads, a widely-consumed carbohydrate source in South Asia.  
Methods: From existing literature, in vitro glucose release, and product feasibility, guar gum (GG), 
konjac mannan (KM) and chickpea flour (CPF) were prioritized for clinical testing in freshly prepared 
flatbreads. Trial 1 (balanced-order incomplete block design, n=38 UK subjects) compared 10 modified 
atta formulations (2/4/6% GG; 2/4% KM; 15% CPF, and 10 or 15% CPF plus 2 or 4% GG) to an 
existing full-fibre commercial product reference. Based on those results, Trial 2 (full crossover design, 
n=50 Indian subjects) tested 3 formulations (15% CPF + 2/3/4% GG). Trial 3 then measured effects of 
CPF+GG on glucose fluxes using dual isotope labelling (n=12 Dutch males). 
Results: In Trial 1, 6% GG, 4% KM, and 15% CPF plus 2 or 4% GG produced significant (p<0.01), 
≥30% reductions in PPG 2-hr incremental area under the curve. A model with 3 in vitro parameters 
closely predicted these results (R2
marked PPI reductions, both GG dose-related. Trial 3 showed these reductions in PPG and PPI 
occurred with modest reductions in glucose uptake and clearance, and much more substantial 
suppression of hepatic glucose production rate.  
Conclusions: 1) The combined CPF+GG formulations significantly reduce PPG and PPI; 2) in vitro 
assays can aid in prioritizing formulations for clinical testing; and 3) the dose-related PPG-lowering 
effects of GG+CPF predominantly reflect post-absorptive effects rather than rates of glucose uptake.
