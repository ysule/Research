Objectives: To assess the impact on client’s perception, dietary intake and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) risk factors of a 6-month healthy lifestyle education program tailored for rural adults with 
prediabetes.   
Methods: Rural adults identified with impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance were 
referred to the 6-month education program by their physician. The program provided participants with 
credible nutrition information and promoted the development of skills regarding healthy eating 
strategies known to help prevent or delay the development of T2DM. Pre- and post-program 3-day 
food records, as well as anthropometric, demographic and biochemical data were collected. 
Participants also completed a program feedback form. Food intake records were reviewed with clients 
by a registered dietitian and analyzed using the ESHA Food Processor SQL version 10.14.0. 
Results: Preliminary data from 21 participants (13 men, 8 women) are presented. They attended 
7.1±0.9 (mean ± SD) out of 8 visits. Participants were aged 61.9±6.5 and their average body mass 
index (BMI) was 32.5±6.6 kg/m2. Ninety percent of the participants said they felt confident that they 
could continue to implement many of the healthy eating strategies learned as part of the prediabetes 
education program. Participants reduced their average energy (2151±675 versus 1771±453 kcal, 
p=0.01) and carbohydrate (250.6±89.0 versus 194.7±44.4 g, p=0,006) intake. Also, the average BMI 
(32.5±6.6 versus 31.6±6.4 kg/m2, p=0.01) and fasting blood glucose (6.07±0.44 versus 5.27±0.54, 
p=0.05) improved significantly from before to after the 6-month education program.  
 
Conclusions:  Based on these preliminary results, it appears that this 6-month healthy lifestyle 
education program may have helped those rural adults improve some of their risk factors for 
developing T2DM, dietary behaviours, and confidence in making healthy eating choices.

Background: Gene variants located upstream of the LCT gene have been associated with lactose 
intolerance (LI) in different ethnic groups. However, the prevalence of these gene variants in Canada 
remains unknown. Individuals with LI often limit or avoid dairy consumption, which may lead to an 
inadequate intake of vitamin D. Recent evidence suggests an inverse association between dairy 
intake and risk of type 2 diabetes.
