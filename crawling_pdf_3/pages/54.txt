Furthermore, significant reduction of liver fat was observed in all subjects (AP: -43.6%, p<0.001; PP: -
37.1%, p<0.001). In the PP group we observed significant reduction of plasma creatinine (-7.79 µmol/l, 
p<0.01) and also enhancement of glomerular filtration rate (from 75.95 to 88.15 ml/min/1.73m2, 
p<0.001) which was not seen in the AP group. Moreover, significant reduction of the HbA1c was 
observed in all subjects (AP: - 0.58%, p < 0.05; PP: - 0.41%, p < 0.001). 
Conclusions: A 6-week high-protein diet leads to improvement of glucose metabolism and liver 
health in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Unexpectedly, high-protein diet had no adverse effects on 
kidney parameters, moreover plant protein showed even favourable impact.

Objective: To compare the effects of standard physical activity advice and postprandial physical 
activity on glycemic control in people with T2DM. 
Methods: Forty-one T2DM adults (HbA1c 58.9 mmol/mol) completed interventions of a 30-min walk 
per day and walking for 10-mins after each main meal for two-weeks, with a four-week washout. 
Continuous glucose monitors were worn to calculate the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for 
each meal and sum of total meals, and blood tests were taken pre- and post interventions.  
Results: After adjustment for intervention order iAUC (mmol/Lmin) was significantly lower for total 
meal iAUC (508 vs. 453, P=0.03) when walking after eating, driven by a highly significant difference in 
iAUC from the evening meal (537 vs. 424, P<0.001). Despite no significant difference between 
interventions (CI -0.15, 0.82), glycemic control as measured by glycated albumin (%) was reduced 
after the 30-min walk (CI -1.08, -0.60).  Change in fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) did not reach 
conventional levels of significance due to the 30-min (CI -1.06, 0.05) or walking after eating 
interventions (CI -1.06, 0.88).  
Conclusions: Walking for 10-mins after each meal improved postprandial glycemic response. Modest 
improvement in some measures of glycemic control occurred following both walking regimens. The 
30-min walk intervention improved glycated albumin, potentially due to a lowered fasting plasma 
glucose level.
