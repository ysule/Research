Results:  Mean age of the participant was 36.9 years (SD 10.2 CI=95%). 77.2% of participants were 
females. Mean BMI of the participants was 23.0 Kgm-2 (SD 3.8, CI = 95. 78.5% of participant stated 
that they do not use a list of good while shopping. Only 30.6% of them chose healthy foods while 
shopping. Usually 50.4% of them buy vegetable and fruits. 28.9% (n=35) of the participants were 
overweight.  
In terms of assessing the dinning pattern, 83.5% do not concern about the recommended amount of 
salt and coconut oil while cooking. 15.7% participants concern about the proportion they eat.

Objectives: The diet is considered as the cornerstone of the regulation of diabetes. Despite the 
current knowledge about the positive impact of the appropriate and healthy diet on type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (DM2) very often this diet is not followed by the diabetic patients. Hippoctates project is a 
study of recording the cardiometabolic risk factor of a specific elderly population, living in the 
municipalities of Maroussi and Nea Ionia, Athens, Greece. The purpose of this study was to document 
the dietary habits of people with type 2 diabetes and to correlate their dietary habits with the total 
treatment of DM. 
Methods: The study enrolled 72 patients (43.1% male) aged over 60 years for 73.1% of the subjects 
(while there was not a statistically significant difference between the sexes, p = 0,205). Patients who 
took part in the study responded to a structured questionnaire on demographic, anthropometric data 
and information related to type 2 diabetes and to another questionnaire with information on their 
dietary habits. 
Results: The mean glycosylated hemoglobin was (HbA1c) 7,69 ± 1,53%, with 32.7% of patients with 
a HbA1c value less than 7%. The duration of diabetes was 7,5 ± 2,1 years. The body mass index 
(BMI) was 32,46 ± 5,92 with no difference between sexes (p = 0,480). 73% of patients were 
overweight - obese [BMI> 25] with women having higher rates (p = 0,011).  
73,9% of patients was consuming breakfast, 37.5% fruits over 8 times per week, 58.4% vegetables at 
least 2 times per week, 41% meat 2 times per week, 45,7% fish once a week , 63,2% pulses once a 
week, 31,2% chicken twice a week, 12.8% once a week. 17.3% of patients consumed sweets. We 
found a positive correlation of the control of diabetes with the breakfast consumption (p <0,0001), 
consumption of vegetables (p = 0,001), of fish (p = 0,001) and of the presence of two main meals in 
the daily program (p = 0,009). Negative effects was found with the higher consumption of junk foods (p 
= 0,008), the consumption of soft drinks (p = 0,036) and the consumption of sweets (p <0,0001). 
Conclusions: The eating habits of people with type 2 diabetes affect the total control of diabetes. A 
well balanced dietary plan which follows the nutritional recommendations has a direct and positive 
effect on the glycemic control.
