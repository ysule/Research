<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Objectives: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">The diet is considered as the cornerstone of the regulation of diabetes. Despite the 
<br>current knowledge about the positive impact of the appropriate and healthy diet on type 2 diabetes 
<br>mellitus (DM2) very often this diet is not followed by the diabetic patients. Hippoctates project is a 
<br>study of recording the cardiometabolic risk factor of a specific elderly population, living in the 
<br>municipalities of Maroussi and Nea Ionia, Athens, Greece. The purpose of this study was to document 
<br>the dietary habits of people with type 2 diabetes and to correlate their dietary habits with the total 
<br>treatment of DM.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:10px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Methods: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">The study enrolled 72 patients (43.1% male) aged over 60 years for 73.1% of the subjects 
<br>(while there was not a statistically significant difference between the sexes, p = 0,205). Patients who 
<br>took part in the study responded to a structured questionnaire on demographic, anthropometric data 
<br>and information related to type 2 diabetes and to another questionnaire with information on their 
<br>dietary habits.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px"> 
<br>Results: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">The mean glycosylated hemoglobin was (HbA1c) 7,69 ± 1,53%, with 32.7% of patients with 
<br>a HbA1c value less than 7%. The duration of diabetes was 7,5 ± 2,1 years. The body mass index 
<br>(BMI) was 32,46 ± 5,92 with no difference between sexes (p = 0,480). 73% of patients were 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">overweight - obese [BMI&gt; 25] with women having higher rates (p = 0,011). </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">73,9% of patients was consuming breakfast, 37.5% fruits over 8 times per week, 58.4% vegetables at 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">least 2 times per week, 41% meat 2 times per week, 45,7% fish once a week , 63,2% pulses once a 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">week, 31,2% chicken twice a week, 12.8% once a week. 17.3% of patients consumed sweets. We 
<br>found a positive correlation of the control of diabetes with the breakfast consumption (p &lt;0,0001), 
<br>consumption of vegetables (p = 0,001), of fish (p = 0,001) and of the presence of two main meals in 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">the daily program (p = 0,009). Negative effects was found with the higher consumption of junk foods (p 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">= 0,008), the consumption of soft drinks (p = 0,036) and the consumption of sweets (p &lt;0,0001). 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Conclusions: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">The eating habits of people with type 2 diabetes affect the total control of diabetes. A 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">well balanced dietary plan which follows the nutritional recommendations has a direct and positive
