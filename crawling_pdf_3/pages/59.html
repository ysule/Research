<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Background:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">  Dietary  advice  in  pregnancy  is  a  key  strategy  promoted  to  prevent  and  manage 
<br>gestational  diabetes  mellitus  (GDM).  However  the  evidence  to  support  various  healthful  dietary 
<br>patterns to achieve optimal glycemic control in pregnant women has not been adequately synthesized.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Objective:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">  To  conduct  a  systematic  review  and  network  meta-analysis  of  randomized  trials  of  ≥4 
<br>week  duration  in  order  to  compare  the  relative  efficacy  of  healthful  dietary  patterns  on  measures  of 
<br>glycemic  control  (fasting  blood  glucose  [FBG]  and  insulin  [FBI],  glycated  hemoglobin  [HbA1c], 
<br>Homeostatic Model Assessment- Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR]) in pregnant women. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Methods</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">:  MEDLINE,  EMBASE,  and  COCHRANE  (to  July  2014)  were  used  to  identify  randomized 
<br>trials of dietary patterns for glycemic control during pregnancy. Two independent reviewers extracted 
<br>relevant  study  characteristics  and  data.  A  network  meta-analysis  using  a  Bayesian  framework  and 
<br>random-effects model was conducted to estimate the effectiveness of dietary patterns on FBG. Owing 
<br>to  a  lack  of  trials  that  met  the  inclusion  criteria,  we  conducted  pair-wise  meta-analyses  using  fixed-
<br>effects model with generic inverse variance  weighting for FBI and HOMA-IR. There were insufficient 
<br>trials to conduct a meta-analysis for HbA1c.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Results:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">  Twelve studies with a median follow-up duration of 13 weeks met our inclusion criteria (n= 
<br>1869). There were no significant differences for any of the dietary comparisons (routine care, energy-
<br>restricted,  high-fibre,  low  glycemic  index,  Dietary  Approach  to  Stop  Hypertension  [DASH]  diets)  on 
<br>FBG.  Pair-wise  meta-analyses  between  high-fibre  and  low  glycemic  index  diets  also  did  not  show 
<br>significant differences on FBI and HOMA-IR. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Limitation: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">&lt;5 trials were identified for comparisons between diets. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Conclusions:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> The preliminary results from these analyses demonstrated that there are no significant 
<br>differences  between  diets  on  FBG,  FBI,  and  HOMA-IR.  Larger  trials  of  higher  quality  are  needed  to 
<br>confirm these results.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Objective</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">: We investigated the associations of proportions of fatty acids in plasma cholesteryl esters 
<br>(CE), phospholipids (PL) and triacylglycerols (TG) with plasma concentration of leptin among Finnish 
<br>children.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Methods</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">:  The  subjects  were  a  population  sample  of  376  children  aged  6-8  years  examined  at 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">baseline  in  the  Physical  Activity  and  Nutrition  in  Children  (PANIC)  study.  Plasma  fatty  acid 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">composition  was  measured  by  gas  chromatography  and  plasma  concentration  of  leptin  by 
<br>radioimmunoassay. Data were analyzed using linear regression models. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Results</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">: Higher proportions of myristic acid and lower proportions of cis-vaccenic acid in plasma CE, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">PL  and  TG  were  associated  with  higher  plasma  concentration  of  leptin. In  CE,    higher  proportion  of 
<br>gamma-linolenic  acid  and  lower  proportion  of  arachidonic  acid  were  associated  with  higher  leptin 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">concentration.  In  PL,  higher  proportion  of  linoleic  acid  and  lower  proportions  of  nervonic  and 
<br>arachidonic  acids  were  associated  with  higher  leptin  concentration.  In  TG,  higher  proportions  of 
<br>palmitic,  stearic  and  gamma-linolenic  acids  and  lower  proportions  of  linoleic,  oleic,  cis-vaccenic  and 
<br>docosapentaenoic acids were related to higher leptin concentration.
