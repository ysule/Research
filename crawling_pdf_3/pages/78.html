<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that has become a global problem. Currently, it is the seventh 
<br>leading cause of death in the United States and affects more than 25 million Americans. It is 
<br>associated with many complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. One of the 
<br>therapeutic approaches to treat diabetes is to slow down the postprandial hyperglycemia through the 
<br>inhibition of α-glucosidase. Drugs like acarbose and miglitol that possess this mechanism of action are 
<br>already in the market. These drugs also produce gastrointestinal symptoms as their side effects. An 
<br>antidiabetic agent with little or no side effects is preferred and will be a better substitute.  The objective 
<br>of this study was to investigate the inhibitory activities of </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:10px">Hibiscus sabdariffa </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">commonly known as 
<br>hibiscus, roselle, zobo drink, or red tea, on α-glucosidase. Roselle extract obtained by homogenizing 
<br>the calyces with ethanol in a blender and evaporating the filtrate, was used in enzyme inhibition 
<br>studies. The study was done in vitro using α-glucosidase obtained from Bacillus Stearothermophilus. 
<br>The inhibition study was carried out in a 96 well plate using PNPG as the substrate and measured with 
<br>Thermo Scientific® Multiskan spectrometer. IC</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:6px">50</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> was obtained and compared with that of acarbose. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">The result showed that roselle has some inhibitory activity on α-glucosidase. However, more studies 
<br>are needed to elucidate its antidiabetic potential.

<br>Objective: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">The prevalence of obesity and obesity-related diseases, like insulin resistance and 
<br>metabolic syndrome, continues to increase worldwide. Our purpose was to investigate the role of the 
<br>peptide angiotensin-(1-7) in the management of adiposity through changes in lipid metabolism. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Methods: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">We evaluated the lipid metabolism of transgenic rats that overexpress an angiotensin 
<br>(Ang)-(1-7)-producing fusion protein, TGR(A1-7)3292 (TGR), which induces a lifetime increase in 
<br>circulating levels of this peptide. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, control (C) and TGR, 12-15 weeks old, 
<br>were used, and body weight and visceral adiposity index were analysed. Serum levels of 
<br>triacylglycerols (TAG) and TAG-VLDL were assayed. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), TAG hydrolases and </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:10px">de
