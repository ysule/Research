Objective: Our previous study showed that consumption of ~60 g/d almonds for 4 weeks improved 
adiposity, glycemic control, lipid profile, oxidative stress, and inflammation in Chinese T2DM patients. 
To substantiate these health benefits, we conducted a 7-month randomized, cross-over, controlled 
feeding trial with 2-wk run-in, 2 phases of 3-mo intervention, and 2-wk washout.  
Methods: Of 727 eligible patients (aged 40-70 y, >5 y diabetes history, 24-35 kg/m2 BMI, 6.5-9% 
HbA1c), 40 patients were enrolled and assigned to consume control diet (CON) prepared based on 
the NCEP step II guidelines and almond diet (ALM) designed by incorporating ~60 g/d almonds to 
CON to replace 20% daily calories. All meals were provided during the intervention phases. The daily 
dose of almonds either was consumed as a snack or was incorporated to foods, e.g., steam bun, 
bread, pizza, and dumpling. Seven subjects dropped out from the trial because of personal reasons. 
Blood was collected before and after each intervention phase for analyses for biomarkers of lipid 
profile, glucoregulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial function.  
Results: Among 33 patients who completed the trial, ALM didn’t improve the studied biomarkers as 
compared to CON. In a subset data, 27 subjects with HbA1c value <8% had a lower HbA1c value at 
the end of the ALM phase than CON (7.01 ± 0.60 vs. 7.23 ± 0.63%, P = 0.027). Similarly, their fasting 
glucose and postprandial insulin release were lower after ALM.  
Conclusions: Almonds incorporated to a healthy diet is beneficial to glycemic control in Chinese 
T2DM patients. While the reduction in HbA1c was modest, bringing its level close to 7% is crucial to 
preventing or delaying development of complications. Factors underlying the less robust outcomes in 
this study than the first trial will be discussed.

Oral Abstract 5 - Guidelines and nut consumption in Norway  
(Lars Johansson, Norway) 
 
Lars Johansson, Norwegian Directorate of Health, lars.johansson@helsedirektoratet.no  
Objective: Evaluate trends in nut consumption in relation to dietary guidelines. Norway included “Eat 
a small handful of unsalted nuts daily” in the dietary guidelines in 2011. This corresponds to 20 gram 
per day, and includes almonds and peanuts. From 2015 packages of unsalted nuts may be labelled 
with the Keyhole symbol. 
Methods: Nut consumption is described by data for import by Statistics Norway, grocery trade by 
Nielsen, Household Consumption Surveys, national dietary surveys among adults and the survey 
Norwegian Eating Facts, Ipsos MMI. 
Results: Import of nuts and peanuts increased from 8 to 10 gram per person per day (g/p/d) during 
1989-2013. Grocery sales of nuts during 2011-2013 were 6 g/p/d.  
The average purchase of nuts, olives and seeds during two weeks reported by households increased 
from 3 to 8 g/p/d from 1982 to 2012. Hereof were nuts 3.8 g, almonds 1.6 g, peanuts 1.6 g and olives 
0.5 g in 2012. The proportion of total intake from nuts, almonds and peanuts was for energy 1.9, 
protein 1.5, fat 1, PUFA 8, CHO 0.2 and fiber 2%.
