<br>intake, growing evidence highlights distinct effects of individual circulating SFA on cardiometabolic 
<br>outcomes, with potential protective effects of odd and longer-chain SFA. Less is known, however, 
<br>regarding the impact of individual SFA on subclinical inflammation, a known predictor of type 2 
<br>diabetes and CVD. The study investigated cross-sectional associations of individual serum SFA (12:0, 
<br>14:0, 15:0, 16:0, 18:0, 20:0, 22:0, and total SFA) with pro-inflammatory biomarkers and adiponectin. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Methods: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">The study analyzed data from 624 White, African American, and Hispanic adults, aged 40-
<br>69 years and free of diabetes at baseline from the IRAS cohort. Serum SFA were analyzed using gas 
<br>chromatography. Clinical measures included oral glucose tolerance tests, fasting serum pro-
<br>inflammatory markers (fibrinogen, CRP, white cell count, PAI-1 and TNF-α), and adiponectin, an 
<br>adipokine which is inversely related to inflammation. Outcome variables included adiponectin 
<br>concentrations as well as inflammatory variable clusters defined by principal components (PC) 
<br>analysis of the five pro-inflammatory markers. Two PCs were identified, PC 1: fibrinogen, CRP and 
<br>white cell count; and PC 2: PAI-1 and TNF-α. Multiple regression analyses were adjusted for 
<br>demographic, lifestyle and dietary variables, waist circumference, and glucose tolerance status. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Results:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Total SFA was not significantly associated with pro-inflammatory markers (PC 1 or PC 2) or 
<br>with adiponectin (p&gt;0.05), however, individual SFA had unique effects. 15:0 (β=-0.10; p=0.01) and 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">22:0 (β=-0.08; p=0.04) were negatively associated, while 14:0 (β=0.13; p=0.0003) and 16:0 (β=0.17; 
<br>p&lt;0.0001) were positively associated with PC 2 in fully adjusted models. Furthermore, 20:0 (β=0.08; 
<br>p=0.03) was positively, and 14:0 (β=-0.15; p&lt;0.0001) and 16:0 (β=-0.15; p&lt;0.0001) were negatively 
<br>associated with adiponectin in fully adjusted models. None of the SFA were associated with PC 1. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Conclusions: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">Lower circulating odd- and longer-chain, and higher even-chain SFA, were related to 
<br>worsened subclinical inflammation status.
