Introduction: In Sri Lanka studies reveal higher trend in prevalence of diabetes. The office employees 
have sedentary life style and their eating patterns changed due to nutritional transition.  
Objective of the study focused on general food pattern of office employees and its relation to 
overweight/obesity and prevalence of   diabetes among them.  
Method:  The data was collected from office employees between 30-60 years (n-400).Data analyzed 
using  SPSS 16 version.The Study design was a descriptive cross sectional study. The study setting 
was Ministry of Economic Development. Anthropometric measurements and blood glucose assessed 
by trained nurses. Dietary pattern was studied through a food frequency questionairre thereby 
calculated daily nutrient intakes.  
Results:  Mean age of office employees were 38.98 SD (7.033) CI=95%) and 245 females (61.2%) 
155 males (38.8 %) ,Nationality includes Sinhala (67.5%), Tamil(20%), and Muslims 
(12.5%).Owerweight(7,1.8%), obese(36,9%), obese(66,16%)/ diabetes/obese(18,4.5%) out of 
127(31.8%) who were above the normal BMI whereas 273(68.2) were within the normal. Mean  BMI 
was 24.1593.Mean Blood sugar level was 104.646,SD(16.018).12% consume tobacco products,17.8 
consumed alcohol.15.8% had nutrition training.  
Two main dietary patterns identified who were vegetarians and non vegetarians .Mean energy intake 
1727.1, (SD 4.97), Mean protein consumption(11.33, SD 1.811), Mean fat consumption(24.07, SD 
4.131),Mean CHO consumption (64.56, SD 4.54), Mean Fibre (30.05, SD 17.9), Mean 
cholesterol(16.85, SD 17.22), Energy intake was higher in non vegetarians and larger propotion of 
energy derived from proteins , and  fat. Their carbohydrate and cholesterol  intake was also higher. 
Tamils were mostly vegetarians. Mainly BMI were within normal range(18.5-23.5) whereas Muslims 
who had higher energy intakes showed BMI above the normal.   
Conclusion â€“ Two distinct dietary patterns identified. Different ethnic groups consume different diets 
with different nutrient composition. Dietary pattern has a relation to overweight. Overweight related to 
high blood glucose levels but some overweight subjects do not show any relation.
