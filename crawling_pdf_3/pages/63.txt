Objective:  The importance of the interrelation of the quality (glycemic index [GI]) and the quantity 
(glycemic load [GL]) of carbohydrate in the context of a mixed meal on blood glucose is still debated. 
This study therefore investigated all 4 permutations of high and low GI and GL meals on postprandial 
glycemia [PPG].   
Methods:  A total of 17 healthy subjects completed all test meals (8 males, 9 females; age 27 ± 12y; 
body mass index 22.2 ± 2.8 kg/m²). Subjects consumed 4 different test meals: LowGI-LowCHO 
(GI=28, GL=14), LowGI-HighCHO (GI=28, GL=42), HighGI-LowCHO (GI=85, GL=14) and HighGI-
HighGL (GI=85, GL=42), with a carbohydrate content of 17, 94, 50 and 50g respectively. Energy was 
balanced by adding fat and protein. Capillary blood samples were collected at fasting and 15, 30, 45, 
60, 90, 120, 190, and 240 minutes post-consumption.   
Results:  The incremental area under the blood glucose curve (iAUC) after the HighGI-HighCHO and 
LowGI-HighCHO meals were significantly higher than the LowGI-LowCHO and HighGI-LowCHO 
meals for 2h post consumption (p<0.05). The 2 to 4h iAUC was significantly higher following the 
LowGI-HighCHO meal compared to the HighGI-HighCHO and HighGI-LowCHO meals.  
Conclusions:  Postprandial glucose levels at 15, 30 and 45min were the lowest after the low GI, low 
GL test meal. Despite almost doubling the carbohydrate in the LowGI-HighCHO meals compared to 
the HighGI-HighCHO meal, there was no difference in iAUC. This preliminary analysis demonstrates 
that changing the GI and GL of meals result in different PPG profiles which were not necessarily 
predicted by carbohydrate content.
