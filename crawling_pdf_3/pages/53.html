<div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:56px; top:108px; width:501px; height:514px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Methods:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Altogether 79 volunteers with elevated fasting plasma glucose (5.5-6.9 mmol/l), BMI 25-36 
<br>kg/m</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:6px">2</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> and age 43 to 72 years participated in the 12-week parallel randomized controlled trial with four 
<br>groups. The fatty fish group consumed 4 meals of fatty fish per week to provide ~ 1 g EPA and DHA 
<br>per day. The lean fish group consumed 4 meals of lean fish per week. The ALA group ingested 
<br>camelina sativa oil in order to get 10 g ALA per day. The control group</span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Calibri; font-size:11px"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">consumed lean meat products. 
<br>Control and ALA groups were allowed to eat 1 fish meal per week.  The study diets were isocaloric. 
<br>Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test 
<br>(FSIGT) were performed and blood samples for analyses of serum lipid profile, fatty acids, 
<br>inflammatory markers and metabolomics and lipidomics profiles were drawn at the beginning and at 
<br>the end of the intervention. ANCOVA models adjusted for age, gender, use of statins and baseline 
<br>value was used for comparing changes between the groups.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Results:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> There were major changes in the fatty acid composition of phospholipids, cholesteryl esters 
<br>and triglycerides in eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid in the fatty fish group and ALA in 
<br>the ALA group, which reflect good compliance to the diets. No significant changes in glucose and 
<br>insulin metabolism were found based on OGTT or FSIGT. Concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol 
<br>(C), LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and Apo B/Apo A-I ratio changed significantly differently between the groups. 
<br>The biggest changes were seen in the ALA group where the total and LDL-C concentrations 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">decreased compared with the fatty fish group and the lean fish group, and LDL-C/HDL-C and Apo 
<br>B/Apo A-I ratios decreased compared with the lean fish group. Inflammatory markers - high sensitivity 
<br>C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) - 
<br>did not change during the intervention. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Conclusion: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">The results suggest that a diet enriched in ALA could improve the serum lipid profile in 
<br>subjects with impaired glucose metabolism. Changes in lipid metabolism are going to be studied in-
<br>depth utilizing metabolomics and lipidomics methods.

<br>(AP) and plant (PP) origin in type 2 diabetic patients. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Methods:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Individuals with type 2 diabetes were randomized to either high-animal or high-plant protein 
<br>diet (30% protein, 40% carbohydrates, 30% fat) for 6 weeks. The AP diet was rich in meat and dairy 
<br>foods, while the PP group received products with high amount of dietary pulses and pea protein. Blood 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">samples were collected every two weeks to measure routine parameters. Magnetic resonance 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">imaging was performed at the beginning and at the end of the study. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Results:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> The study included 30 subjects (age 65±6 years, BMI 30.5±3.6 kg/m</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:6px">2</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">, HbA</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:6px">1c</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> 7.0±0.6%). We 
<br>observed reduction of cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol in all participants. Levels of liver 
<br>parameters (AST, ALT, GGT) in blood improved significantly after diet intervention in both groups.
