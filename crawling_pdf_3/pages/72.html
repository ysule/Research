<br>whether those genotypes are associated with dairy intake, circulating 25(OH)-vitamin D concentrations 
<br>and biomarkers of type 2 diabetes. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Methods:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Fasting blood samples were drawn from a total of 649 Caucasians aged 20-29 years from 
<br>the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study, for genotyping, plasma 25-OH vitamin D, fasting glucose 
<br>and insulin. Dairy intake was assessed using a one-month, 196-item food frequency questionnaire. 
<br>Analysis of covariance was used to determine the association between genotype and dairy intake, 25-
<br>OH vitamin D, as well as biomarkers of type 2 diabetes. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Results:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Approximately 33% had the CC genotype at position -13910, which has previously been 
<br>associated with LI. The CC genotype was significantly associated with lower circulating 25-OH vitamin 
<br>D (p=0.0001). This association was due, at least in part, to low total dairy intake (p=0.003), particularly 
<br>skim milk in this population (p=0.0008). No significant association was observed between the -
<br>13910C&gt;T gene variant and biomarkers of type 2 diabetes. Total dairy intake was inversely 
<br>associated with fasting glucose (p=0.04); however, the association was attenuated after adjusting for 
<br>age, sex, and BMI (p=0.08).  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Conclusion:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> The LCT genotype that has been implicated to LI is associated with lower plasma levels 
<br>of vitamin D, which could impact the risk of certain chronic diseases.

<br>Introduction: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">Food systems, both traditional and modern, are fundamentally connected to the health 
<br>and welfare of society. Furthermore, there are concerns that income growth, urbanization, and 
<br>supermarket penetration in developing countries may contribute to an “obesogenic” diet transition, 
<br>particularly increased consumption of energy-dense processed food at the expense of fresh fruits and 
<br>vegetables and grains. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">Objective of the study is to determine the difference of healthy food choices between people who use 
<br>supermarket and public market in Kandy District, Sri Lanka.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Method</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">: Data was collected from individuals who visit supermarket (n=214) and individuals who use 
<br>public market (n=124) during three hours of time. Good pack of those who provided the consent, was 
<br>assessed by using a check list. Weight and height measurement was taken using standard methods. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">SPSS 16 version was used to assess the data.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Results</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">: Mean age of supermarket and public market visitors were (45.8 SD (13.9) CI=95%) and 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">(49.5 SD 13.8 CI = 95%). 165 females (73.7%) were in supermarket group while 84 females (67.7 %) 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">were in  public market group. 77.2% supermarket visitors and 67.7% public market visitors are regular 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">customers. Vegetable and fruit contain of the supermarket users, are 35.7% and 29% respectively, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">while 81.5% and 50.8% of public market users have vegetable and fruits in their good pack. 
<br>Availability of carbohydrate enriched food in supermarket and public market are   61.6% and 62.1% 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">respectively. In terms of availability of processed meat products, supermarket and public market users 
<br>are 40.6% and 17.7%. Mean BMI of the supermarket and public market group is 25.4 Kgm</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:6px">-2</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> (SD 4.07)

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">public market users are overweight and obese.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Conclusion</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">: compared to the public market users, supermarket customers likely to contain more 
<br>unhealthy foods and less amount of vegetable and fruits in their good pack.
