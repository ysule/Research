<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Objective:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Our previous study showed that consumption of ~60 g/d almonds for 4 weeks improved 
<br>adiposity, glycemic control, lipid profile, oxidative stress, and inflammation in Chinese T2DM patients. 
<br>To substantiate these health benefits, we conducted a 7-month randomized, cross-over, controlled 
<br>feeding trial with 2-wk run-in, 2 phases of 3-mo intervention, and 2-wk washout.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Methods:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Of 727 eligible patients (aged 40-70 y, &gt;5 y diabetes history, 24-35 kg/m</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:6px">2 </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">BMI, 6.5-9% 
<br>HbA1c), 40 patients were enrolled and assigned to consume control diet (CON) prepared based on 
<br>the NCEP step II guidelines and almond diet (ALM) designed by incorporating ~60 g/d almonds to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">CON to replace 20% daily calories. All meals were provided during the intervention phases. The daily 
<br>dose of almonds either was consumed as a snack or was incorporated to foods, e.g., steam bun, 
<br>bread, pizza, and dumpling. Seven subjects dropped out from the trial because of personal reasons. 
<br>Blood was collected before and after each intervention phase for analyses for biomarkers of lipid 
<br>profile, glucoregulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial function.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Results:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Among 33 patients who completed the trial, ALM didn’t improve the studied biomarkers as 
<br>compared to CON. In a subset data, 27 subjects with HbA1c value &lt;8% had a lower HbA1c value at 
<br>the end of the ALM phase than CON (7.01 ± 0.60 vs. 7.23 ± 0.63%, P = 0.027). Similarly, their fasting 
<br>glucose and postprandial insulin release were lower after ALM.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Conclusions:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Almonds incorporated to a healthy diet is beneficial to glycemic control in Chinese 
<br>T2DM patients. While the reduction in HbA1c was modest, bringing its level close to 7% is crucial to 
<br>preventing or delaying development of complications. Factors underlying the less robust outcomes in 
<br>this study than the first trial will be discussed.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Objective:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Evaluate trends in nut consumption in relation to dietary guidelines. Norway included “Eat 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">a small handful of unsalted nuts daily” in the dietary guidelines in 2011. This corresponds to 20 gram 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">per day, and includes almonds and peanuts. From 2015 packages of unsalted nuts may be labelled 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">with the Keyhole symbol. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Methods:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Nut consumption is described by data for import by Statistics Norway, grocery trade by 
<br>Nielsen, Household Consumption Surveys, national dietary surveys among adults and the survey 
<br>Norwegian Eating Facts, Ipsos MMI. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Results:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Import of nuts and peanuts increased from 8 to 10 gram per person per day (g/p/d) during 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">1989-2013. Grocery sales of nuts during 2011-2013 were 6 g/p/d.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">The average purchase of nuts, olives and seeds during two weeks reported by households increased 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">from 3 to 8 g/p/d from 1982 to 2012. Hereof were nuts 3.8 g, almonds 1.6 g, peanuts 1.6 g and olives 
<br>0.5 g in 2012. The proportion of total intake from nuts, almonds and peanuts was for energy 1.9, 
<br>protein 1.5, fat 1, PUFA 8, CHO 0.2 and fiber 2%.
