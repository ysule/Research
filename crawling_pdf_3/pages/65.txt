related end-points will be investigated. Interactions with habitual stress, sleeping pattern, behavioral, 
environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic variables are also being studied.  
The intervention starts with an 8-week weight loss phase on a low-calorie diet, LCD (Cambridge 
Weight Plan) followed by randomization to a 146-weeks weight maintenance phase in the 4 
intervention arms.   
Results: Between Jun 2013 and February 2015, ~15,500 adults have been pre-screened; ~5400 
screened and 2279 adults enrolled by the 8 intervention centres. Around 70 children/adolescents have 
also been included. The average age of the adults is 52 y, ~ 2/3 being female. A total of 1356 have 
achieved more than 8% weight loss by the end of the 8-week LCD (average ~11% of initial body 
weight of ~100 kg), allowing them to continue into the weight maintenance phase.  
Conclusions: The PREVIEW project is running well with over 2200 participants enrolled in the RCT. 
Protocol Registration:  NCT01777893 
Funding: The PREVIEW project receives funding from the EU 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-
2013) under grant agreement no. 312057. National Health and Medical Research Council - EU 
Collaborative Grant, AUS. The NZ Health Research Council (14/191) and UoA Faculty Research 
Development Fund. The Cambridge Weight Plan has kindly donated all products for the 8-week Low-
Calorie Diet.

Background: Consumption of dairy is associated with better body composition and lower incidences 
of type 2 diabetes. Studies show this may be due to dairyâ€™s effects on decreasing post-prandial 
glycemia. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the benefits of familiar dairy products, 
consumed in usual serving sizes and as part of a meal, on postprandial glycemia and insulin 
responses. Recently, Health Canada (HC) has released draft guidance documents for food health 
claims for the reduction in post-prandial glycemia. Therefore, the present study is aimed to evaluate 
the potential for dairy to carry comparative health claims relative to non-dairy alternatives.  
Objective: To compare the effects of dairy and non-dairy beverages on post-prandial glycemia 
following the guidelines set forth by HC.   
Methods: Thirty healthy males and females (20-30 years, BMI 20.0-24.9 kg/m2) will be recruited for 
this randomized, crossover trial. The treatments are 250 mL of 1) 1% milk, 2) soy beverage, 3) almond 
beverage, 4) yogurt beverage, and 5) water consumed with 54 g of Cheerios cereal. At 0 (baseline), 
15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 minutes (pre-meal period) 140, and 170 minutes (post-meal period) blood 
will be collected for glucose analysis. Insulin will be analyzed every 30 minutes and for the last two 
timepoints. An ad libitum pizza meal will be provided at 120 minutes after the treatments to measure 
post-meal glucose and insulin as well as food intake. Results: Study sessions have commenced and 
8 participants have now completed the study. Preliminary data suggests that dairy beverages (milk 
and yogurt) may reduce post-prandial glycemia levels more than non-dairy alternatives. Complete 
results, which will be available at the time of the symposium, may provide further support for 
increasing dairy consumption and for increasing communication of its post-prandial benefits through a 
health claim.
