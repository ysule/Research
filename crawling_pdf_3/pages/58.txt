Objective: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering has been the focused of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, however, despite highly effective statin therapy for LDL-C 
lowering, residual risk remains. Therefore, alternative lipid targets, ie. apolipoprotein B (apoB) and 
non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), have been implemented to assess residual risk. 
β-glucan, the main soluble fibre found in oats, is often ascribed with being the main active component 
responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect. Given the established LDL-C lowering effect of oat β-
glucan (OβG), this systematic review and meta-analysis seeks to update the evidence in the context of 
OβG and LDL-C and additionally, to summarize and quantify the effect of OβG on the alternate lipid 
targets, apoB and non-HDL-C, for the first time.   
Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were 
searched. Randomized controlled trials ≥3 weeks reporting OβG consumption on LDL-C, apoB and/or 
non-HDL-C. Two independent reviewer’s extracted relevant data and assessed study quality and risk 
of bias. Data were pooled using the generic inverse variance method with random effects models and 
expressed as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI’s). Heterogeneity was assessed 
(Cochran Q-statistic) and quantified (I2). 
Results: 51 trials were included (n=3420). A median dose of 3.6 g/d significantly lowered LDL-C 
(MD=-0.23 [95% CI: -0.33, -0.14]; p<0.00001), apoB (MD=-0.05 [95% CI: -0.08, -0.02]; p<0.00001) 
and non-HDL-C (MD=-0.24 [95% CI: -0.28, -0.20]; p<0.00001) compared with control diets.  
Conclusion: Pooled analyses confirm an LDL-C lowering effect with consumption of OβG. It 
additionally implicates a beneficial effect on alternate lipid targets, apoB and non-HDL-C. Though, the 
results may be limited by the short duration, poor quality of the majority of the trials, and significant 
between-study heterogeneity.
