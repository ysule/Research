Jared Carlberg, Ph.D., is Associate Professor of Agribusiness & 
Agricultural Economics and Associate Dean (Academic) in the Faculty of 
Agricultural and Food Sciences at the University of Manitoba. His 
research focuses on the economic costs of food-related chronic 
diseases, consumer preferences for food products, and the relationships 
between food intake decisions and self-perceptions of the impacts of 
food choice on future health states.

The interplay between nutrition and lifestyle-related health outcomes has been well-established. More 
recently, focus has been shifting to the economic costs of nutrition-related disease, with the impact of 
food choices on health-related costs gaining considerable attention. Not only could tens of thousands 
of deaths be averted or delayed each year, but also substantial economic savings could be realized if 
a greater proportion of the population complied with dietary recommendations. Adopting health-
conscious nutritional habits that are known to reduce disease risk could thus reduce the economic 
strain associated with treating nutrition-related chronic disorders. Our research has focused on the 
economic valuations of functional foods and certain dietary entities, as well as those of overall 
dietary improvements.Through a series of economic framework designs encompassing variations of 
cost-of-illness analyses, we have provided evidence of non-trivial savings in costs associated with 
public health concerns following greater adherence to dietary guidelines and policies.
