<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:11px">Why do we need large pragmatic outcomes RCT’s of nutritional interventions? 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">Changes in nutrition throughout history have had remarkable effects on clinically important outcomes. 
<br>Such clinically important outcomes include death, strokes, disability, cognitive decline and other things 
<br>that are important to both patients as well as healthcare providers. Nutritional interventions that can be 
<br>proven to have clinically important effects on these health outcomes are likely to be rapidly adopted by 
<br>people. Conversely interventions that simply affect biochemical or clinical parameters such as serum 
<br>analytes or blood pressure or glucose level will be subject to controversy. Large clinical outcomes 
<br>trials that are focused on outcomes that are important to society, patients and providers are clearly the 
<br>best way to demonstrate the value of new nutritional interventions in the general population and in 
<br>subgroups such as those with diabetes. Such trials can do this convincingly and effectively because of 
<br>the very powerful tool of randomization. Epidemiological approaches that analyze databases or even 
<br>prospectively recruit and follow participants are unable to clearly establish the effect of any 
<br>intervention. At best they can identify risk factors and stratify people into lower versus higher risk 
<br>groups. They may also suggest hypotheses regarding the effects of interventions however they are 
<br>unable to determine whether: (a) any particular therapy is effective at reducing outcomes; (b) any 
<br>benefits of such therapies outweigh the risks; and (c) whether the measured effect is due to the 
<br>therapy or to patient characteristics associated with the propensity to get the therapy and the outcome. 
<br>Conversely the randomized controlled trial is able to make this determination because randomization 
<br>ensures that: (a) both measured and unmeasured confounders are randomly distributed within the 2 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">groups; and (if the groups are large enough) the groups are equal on average except for the therapy 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">provider that will not provide it. Once the trial is finished researchers can assume with great 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">confidence that any difference in outcomes between the 2 groups is due to the therapy that was 
<br>assessed. Such clinical trials are arduous and costly however they are indispensable and have 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">definitively and unequivocally proven the benefits of a wide variety of therapies throughout medicine. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">This evidence is used by governments and other third party payers to justify adoption of these 
<br>therapies and have dramatically reduced outcomes in various populations.
