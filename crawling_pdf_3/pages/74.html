<br>di-homo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3n-6) and estimated stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase 1 and delta-6 
<br>desaturase (D6D) enzyme activities significantly predicted the worsening of glycemia, whereas total 
<br>PUFA, linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and elongase activity were the main predictors for decreased Glucose 
<br>AUC. Estimated D6D activity and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3n-6) increased the risk of incident 
<br>T2DM. The results were consistent across the three different lipid fractions, but FA proportions in PL

<br>TG.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Objective:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> A higher consumption of fruits and vegetable (FV) may confer a lower risk of developing 
<br>type 2 diabetes. This protective link may be partly attributable to flavonoids provided by these foods 
<br>(FV-flavonoid). In addition, many fruits in particular are also characterized by a low or intermediate 
<br>glycemic index (GI). This study examined the prospective associations of habitual FV or FV-flavonoid 
<br>intake during puberty with homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), alanine 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">aminotransferase (ALT) and </span><span style="font-family: Symbol; font-size:10px"></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">-glutamyltransferase (GGT) in younger adulthood and whether these are 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">partly attributable to the dietary GI.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Methods:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> Healthy participants from the DONALD Study were eligible for analysis if they had provided 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">a fasting blood sample in adulthood (18-39 y) and at least two 3-day dietary records during puberty 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">(girls: 9-15y, boys: 10-16y, n=260). Additional multivariable regression analyses among those 
<br>providing at least three 24-h urines in puberty (n=222) addressed urinary hippuric acid (HA), a 
<br>biomarker of FV-flavonoid.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Results:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> A higher FV intake was independently related to lower HOMA-IR values (p</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:6px">trend</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">=0.03) and a 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">tendency for lower GGT values (p</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:6px">trend</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">=0.099) in adulthood. These associations were removed by 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">additional inclusion of dietary GI (conditional model, p=0.2 and p=0.5). Similarly, associations between 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">higher HA excretion in puberty and lower adult HOMA-IR (p=0.03) and GGT (p=0.0001) were 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">attenuated in a conditional model with dietary GI (p=0.08 and p=0.0005). Associations between 
<br>pubertal HA and adult ALT (p=0.009) were not responsive to dietary GI adjustments. FV-flavonoids 
<br>estimated from dietary records were not related to adult risk markers of type 2 diabetes (p&gt;0.05).
