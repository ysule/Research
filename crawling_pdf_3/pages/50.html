<br>and thus may have an impact on managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular 
<br>disease (CVD).   Worldwide health agencies recommend individuals increase the intake of fruit for 
<br>improved health maintenance, including patients with diabetes mellitus.  Traditional dried fruit without 
<br>added sugar, such as raisins, are considered healthful foods and are a preferred snack because of 
<br>their nutrient profile, which is rich in dietary fiber, potassium and health protective bioactive 
<br>compounds.  Dried fruit, like all commonly consumed fruit, provide sugar (e.g., fructose and glucose) 
<br>as the only caloric macronutrient.  This may raise concern for patients with diabetes mellitus regarding 
<br>the potential to affect glycemic control.   However, raisins have a low glycemic index, resulting in a low 
<br>potential for insulinemic and glycemic response.   While most fruits and vegetables have not 
<br>undergone the rigors of objective clinical trial evaluation, a 12-week randomized controlled clinical 
<br>study of 51 participants evaluated routine intake of raisins versus equicaloric, high carbohydrate 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">processed snacks (e.g. crackers, crisps) on cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with T2DM.  Those 
<br>who consumed raisins had a significant (p&lt;.05) 23% reduction in postprandial glucose levels, a 19% 
<br>reduction in fasting blood sugar and a 0.12 % reduction in hemoglobin A1c (p&gt;.05) (NS).  Also 
<br>compared to process snacks, raisins produced a significant 8.7mmHg reduction in systolic blood 
<br>pressure, possibly due to potassium and other vasoactive raisin constituents.   Body weight, 
<br>anthropometric measures, and blood lipid levels did not change. This data was generally consistent 
<br>with another objective controlled trial of raisins among patients with hyperglycemia, but not diabetes 
<br>mellitus.  Emerging data will be presented supporting the role of raisins and other traditional dried 
<br>fruits as a healthy component of the daily diet, including patients with T2DM.

<br>existing epidemiological studies of ASB-T2DM. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Materials and Methods.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> We searched PubMed and Scopus to identify prospective observational 
<br>studies on ASB and T2DM.  Data collected from these studies were combined using random effects 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">meta-analysis.  We identified possible confounders, assessed the control of confounding in the

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">bias suggested evidence of selective reporting of positive findings; a tally of cohorts that have reported 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">on diet and T2D (N=22) suggests that the ASB-T2D relationship is published in only a subset (N=7). 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Conclusions.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> The observed relationship between ASB and T2DM, although more homogeneous than 
<br>previous estimates, remains a weak association lacking dose-response.  Approximately 15 studies 
<br>exist with unpublished data on diet and T2DM, providing an argument for the need for further research 
<br>on this controversial topic to address prominent uncertainties.
