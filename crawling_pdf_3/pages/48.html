<br>survey among adults 2010 using 2x24h recall. 
<br>The proportion of adults reporting to consume unsalted nuts or nut mixes once a week or more 
<br>increased from 9 til 12% during 2009-2013 according to Norwegian Eating Facts. In 2013 the 
<br>proportion consuming unsalted nuts never or rarely was 34% and daily 2%. 
<br>The proportion that ate salted peanuts at least weekly increased from 8 to 9% during 2009-2013. In 
<br>2013 the proportion consuming salted peanuts never or rarely was 32%. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:10px">Conclusions:</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px"> The consumption of nuts is increasing, but it is far from recommended levels. A large

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">Physical activity improves the regulation of glucose homeostasis in both type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
<br>patients and healthy individuals, but the effect on pancreatic β cell function is unknown. We 
<br>investigated glycaemic control, pancreatic function and total fat mass before and after 8 weeks of low 
<br>volume high intensity interval training (HIIT) on cycle ergometer in T2D patients and matched healthy 
<br>control individuals. Study design/method: Elderly (56 yrs±2), non-active T2D patients (n=10) and 
<br>matched (52 yrs±2) healthy controls (CON) (n=13) exercised 3 times (10×60 sec. HIIT) a week over 
<br>an 8 week period on a cycle ergometer. Participants underwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test 
<br>(OGTT). On a separate day, resting blood pressure measurement was conducted followed by an 
<br>incremental maximal oxygen uptake (V̇ O2max) cycle ergometer test. Finally, a whole body dual X-ray 
<br>absorptiometry (DXA) was performed. After 8 weeks of training, the same measurements were 
<br>performed. Results: glycaemic control as determined by fasting venous glucose concentration, end 
<br>point 2-hour OGTT and glycosylated haemoglobin was significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05). Pancreatic 
<br>homeostasis as determined by homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and 
<br>HOMA β cell function (HOMA-%β) were both reduced significantly (p&lt;0.05). Whole body insulin 
<br>sensitivity as determined by the disposition index (DI) was significantly increased (p&lt;0.05). During 
<br>OGTT, the glucose continuum was significantly reduced at -15, 15 and 120 min (p&lt;0.05) and at -10 
<br>and 0 min (p&lt;0.01) with an additional improvement (p&lt;0.05) of its 1st phase (30 min) AUC. Significant 
<br>abdominal fat mass losses were seen in both groups (T2D: p&lt;0.01 and CON: p&lt;0.05) corresponding 
<br>to a percentage change of -17.84 %±5.02 and -9.66 %±3.07, respectively.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">Conclusion: These results demonstrate that HIIT improves overall glycaemic control and pancreatic β 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">cell function in T2D patients. Additionally, both groups experienced abdominal fat mass losses. These 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:10px">findings demonstrate that HIIT is a health beneficial exercise strategy in T2D patients.
