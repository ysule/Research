Abstract 

End  Stage  Renal  Disease  is  the  major  unavoidable  health  burden  of  diabetic  complications.  The  biopsy  and 
microalbuminuria  is  presently  considered  as  an  early  stage  of  diabetic  nephropathy  with  known  limitations.  N-
Acetyl  β  D-  Glucosaminidase  (NAG)  is  one  of  the  principal  enzyme  involved  in  mucopolysaccharide  and 
glycoprotein  metabolism  of  basement  membrane  of  proximal  tubule.  The  proximal  tubular  damage  leads  to  the 
source  of  lysosomal  enzymes  excretion  in  the  earliest  stages  of  diabetic  nephropathy.  Thus  lysosomal  enzymes 
excreted  in urine can  be  used as non invasive diagnostic  test. Hence, the aim  of the study was to assess the early 
involvement  of NAG  in progression of the  condition. A total of 436 patients, consisting of  normal healthy  adults 
(Group  A,  N=70),  diabetics  without  any  complications  (Group  B,  N=166),  diabetics  with  microalbuminuria 
(Group  C,  N=50),  diabetic  nephropathy  (Group  D,  N=100)  and  other  nephropathy  (Group  E,  N=50)  were 
considered for the study. Activities of NAG (U/g creatinine) for Group A, B, C, D and E are expressed as mean ± 
SD: 0.76 ± 0.7, 1.74 ± 1.2, 13.87 ± 1.1, 15.87 ± 2.6 and 0.44 ± 0.3 respectively. A significant elevation in groups 
B, C and D is seen when compared  with the control group  (group A  vs. groups B, C and D: P<0.0001) and that 
with  group  E  (group  A  vs.  group  E:  P=0.136)  showed  no  significance.  The  result  thus  suggests  NAG  as  a  site 
specific  non  invasive  diagnostic  biomarker  useful  to  predict  the  early  progression  of  secondary  complication  of 
diabetes (specifically Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) in our study.
