Abstract 

According  to  the  latest  data  from  International  Diabetes  Federation  (IDF),  at  least  366  million  people  are  living 
with diabetes  and  this  number  is  projected  to  be  552  million  by  2030.  At  least  50%  people  with  diabetes  suffer 
from  one  or  two  major  diabetic  complications  such  as  diabetic  cardiomyopathy,  nephropathy,  neuropathy, 
retinopathy and diabetic foot diseases. This lecture will discuss evidence that life style modification and selective 
nutraceuticals supplementation, such as, Broccoli and Curcumin can retard and prevent the on-set of diabetes and 
progression of complications associated with diabetes.
