Abstract 

The fruit of DI25 has been an integral part of the Assamese cuisine .A randomized clinical trial was carried out on 
40  patients.  Clinical  study  reveals  the  hypoglycemic  activity  of  DI25  in  Type  2  Diabetes  Mellitus  patients, 
following  standardized  approach.  Fruit  powder  of  DI25  showed  significant  hypoglycemic  effect  (p<0.001).  The 
powder  was  given  in  the  dose  of  30  grams  daily  in  two  divided  doses,  for  24  weeks  .The  results  were  assessed 
according to the change in parameters as per standard criteria. Statistical analysis was done using all values which 
are  expressed  as  mean  ±  SD  and  calculating  the  t-value  of  mean  difference  between  before  treatment  and  after 
every  follow up. The  results were  assessed through  ‘p’  value  and paired‘t’ test. Blood glucose was  measured by 
glucose oxidase method and HbA1c by ion exchange chromatography. Among 40 cases of diabetes mellitus mean 
FBS level before treatment is 158 +16.1, after treatment with the trial drug the mean difference in each follow up 
had  increased  gradually  from  139.2±  8.1  at  8  weeks  to  119.3±4.1  at  16  weeks  and  98.7±1.1  at  24th  week  of 
treatment. Similarly in case of post prandial blood sugar (PPBS) the effect of treatment on the PPBS is found to be 
statistically  highly  significant  (P<  0.001).The  mean  difference  had  increased  gradually  from  180±5.6  to 
168.45±12.1  and  155.9±16.7  at  8,16  and  24  weeks  of  treatment  respectively.  The  level  of  Glycosylated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) is found to be statistically highly significant after 24weeks of taking the trial drug DI25. The 
initial mean HbA1c was 8.7 was reduced to 6.8 after treatment.
