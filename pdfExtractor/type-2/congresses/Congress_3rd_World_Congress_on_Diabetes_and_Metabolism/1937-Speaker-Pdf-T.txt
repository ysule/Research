Abstract 

The  study  was  carried  out  to  estimate  thyroid  hormones  (T3,  T4  and  TSH)  level  in  diabetic  patients  and  to 
compare  it  with normal  controls.  And,  also  to  find  out the importance  of  thyroid  hormone  estimation  in diabetic 
cases. Sixty cases of diabetes mellitus who attended Diabetic clinic, RIMS hospital during the period from October 
2008 to March 2010 were taken as case. Thirty healthy individuals were selected as control group. Serum total Tri-
iodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), thyroid stimulating hormone and blood sugar were estimated in the cases and 
controls.   The study showed that diabetes was more prevalent in the age group of 51-65 years and more in males 
(52%).  The  mean  fasting  blood  sugar  (126.17  +  37.92  mg%)  and  serum  TSH  level  (4.58+2.90  mIU/L)were 
increased  significantly  (r  =  0.884,p>0.05)    whereas  serum  T4  level  (5.79+4.39  Âµg/dl)  was  decreased  in  diabetic 
cases  when  compared  with  controls.  Mean  T3  level  of  diabetic  cases  was  higher  than  controls  but  it  was 
insignificant.  Diabetes  mellitus  cases  with  statistically  significant  higher  TSH  value  have  complications  like 
hypertension, retinopathy, nephropathy etc. A statistically significant, negative correlation(r=- 0.942, p<0.05 ) was 
seen  between  Serum  T4  and blood sugar  in the cases.   Therefore, routine assessment  of thyroid hormone level in 
addition to other biochemical variables in the early stage of diabetes will help patients to improve their health and 
reduce their mortality rate.
