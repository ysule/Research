Abstract 

Background:  Sensorimotor  dysfunction  is  mainly  considered  for  the  diagnosis  of  peripheral  neuropathy. 
Autonomic  small  C-Fibers  innervating  sweat  glands  are  thin,  long  and  unmyelinated  and  can  be  damaged  very 
early in the diabetes process. Sweat  dysfunction leading to abnormal skin conditions could increase diabetic foot 
risk. A consensus statement of  American Diabetes Association  has  suggested that sudomotor function  should be 
included  in diagnostic  tests  for  the  detection  of  neuropathies  in  diabetes  but  lack  of  simple,  and  quick  methods 
have  restricted  the  widespread  of  such  examination.  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  SUDOSCAN  a  new 
method to measure sudomotor function as a screening tool for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. 
Materials and methods: 191 patients with type 2 diabetes (age 51 ± 11 years, diabetes duration 8 ± 6 years, BMI 
28  ±  5  kg/m2)  were  measured  for  Vibration  Perception  Threshold  (VPT)  using  a  biothesiometer  with  ≥  15  V  as 
cut-off value for diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Retinopathy status and renal function, based on estimation of 
glomerular filtration rate using  Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), were  also assessed as  indicators 
of  microvascular  lesions.  All  patients  underwent  the  SUDOSCAN  test.  Patients  place  their  hands  and  feet  on 
stainless-steel  electrodes  and  an  incremental  low  direct  voltage  (<  4  V)  is  applied  during  a  2  minute  interval. 
Electrochemical  Sweat  Conductance  (ESC)  as  a  measure  of  sudomotor  function  was  obtained  from  the  voltage 
and current applied.  Quantitative results are expressed as ESC (microsiemens, µS) for the hands  and feet. A risk 
score for cardiac neuropathy was calculated based on these values and demographic data.  
Results:  Based  on  biothesiometer  examination,  patients  were  classified  in  two  groups:  Patients  with  or  without 
neuropathy.

Conclusion:  Sweating  status  using  SUDOSCAN  a  simple,  quick  and  non  inveasive  method  may  be  used  as  a 
screening tool of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Relevance  of the method could be explained by earlier damages 
in small C-fiber when compared to large fibers.
