Abstract 

Diabetes mellitus is a common disease in the world. It is estimated that over 30 million people are already caught 
with  diabetes, and  10.4 million diabetics are not aware of the  existing disease. Diabetes prevalence has increased 
steadily in the last half of this century and will continue rising among world population. It is believed to be one of 
the  main  criterions  for  deaths  in  world;  every  year.  Main  utility  of  the  Āyurveda  science  is  to  help  maintain  the 
health of a healthy individual and cure of diseases of patient. In Āyurveda, diabetes is known as ‘Prameha’ which 
means  profuse  urination.  It  is  also  believed  that  increased  kapha  blocks  the  channel  of  the  urinary  system  and 
pancreas and is responsible for producing low tissue fire or mandha-dhatuagni which results in malformation of all 
the tissue in  body. According to Āyurvedic  view  all causative  factors  of diabetes could be categorized under two 
main factors, mean foods and behavioral. Caraka Ācārya has explained all facts in briefly, Indulging in sitting on 
soft cushions for long periods, sleeping for long hours, use of curds, fresh grains, puddings made of jiggery/sugar 
and all other similar factors which bring about increase of Kapha in the body are causes for diabetes. According to 
Āyurveda view Kapha causes Premehas by affecting Medas (lipid metabolism), muscles and body fluid situated in 
urinary  bladder.This  paper  summarizes  Āyurveda  evidence  supporting  to  prevent  diabetes  and  discusses  major 
policy challenges to broad implementation of lifestyle intervention in the health system
