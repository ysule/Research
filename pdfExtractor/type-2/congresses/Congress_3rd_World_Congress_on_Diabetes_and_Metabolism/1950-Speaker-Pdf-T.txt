Abstract 

A  total  of  50  patients  already  diagnosed  as  Type  II  DM  with  hypertension,  attending  diabetic  clinic,  RIMS 
Hospital  as  well  as  admitted  in  medicine  ward  included  in  the  present  study.  Another  30  healthy  age  and  sex 
matched  subjects  who  were  free  from  any  systemic  diseases  were  taken  as  control.  Fasting  blood  glucose  was 
estimated by glucose oxidase peroxidase method as described by Trinder P, 1969. Serum triglyceride was done by 
method  of  Bucole  G  and  Harold  D  1973,  and  glycosylated  haemoglobin  by  fast  ion  exchange  Resin  Separation 
method as described by Goldstein DE et al 1994. Thirty four (34%) percent of hypertensive diabetic cases were in 
the age group of 51-60 years followed by 30% in the age group of 41-50 years, 18% in 61-70 years and 8% above 
70 years.  The  mean ± SD concentration of fasting serum triglyceride (TG)  was significantly  higher (P<0.001) in 
study  group (168.89 ± 57.74 mg/dl) as compared with control cases (72.97 ± 12.77 mg/dl). Maximum number  of 
cases (33) was having serum TG level more than 170 mg/dl. There was a positive correlation between serum TG 
and  HbA1C  among  the  study  group.  As  percentage  of  HbA1C  increased,  the  value  of  serum  TG  also  increased. 
Significant increase (P<0.001) of  HbA1C was observed among  DM cases compared to controls. Thirty cases (30) 
belong to poor glycermic status as indicated by HbA1C (6-9%) whereas 15 cases and 3 cases belong to worst and 
good  glycemic control with HbA1C level  > 9% and 6% respectively.  The complications  were  common with poor 
and worst glycemic controls. This study shows that serum TG increases in Type II DM with hypertension, and is 
positively correlated with HbA1C levels.
