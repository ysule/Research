  Abstract 

The  Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System  (RAAS) is a regulator of blood pressure as well as kidney functions 
and is suggested to play an important role in the development of nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetes. Aldosterone is 
an important component of RAAS, and plays an important role in controlling blood pressure, water and electrolyte 
homeostasis in the body. Aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2) polymorphism has been reported to be associated 
with serum aldosterone level, blood  pressure, and diabetic complication such  as nephropathy and left  ventricular 
size  and  mass.  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  relation  between  CYP11B2  gene  (-344  C>T)  promoter 
polymorphism and type 2 diabetic patients in the Indian population.The present study was carried out among 323 
subjects  of  both  sexes,  consisting  of  205 type  2  diabetes  patients  (T2DM)  and 118  healthy  controls.  Genotyping 
was  performed  by  polymerase  chain  reaction  -restriction  fragment  length  polymorphism  analysis  (PCR-RFLP). 
The  frequencies  of  CYP11B2  gene  CC,  CT,  TT  genotypes  among  the  cases  T2DM,  and  Controls  are  (13.17  %, 
51.70 %, and 35.12 %. T2DM; 16.95 %, 38.14 %, 44.91 % controls) respectively.  Our study failed to identify any 
association  of  CYP11B2  gene  (-344  C>T)  promoter  polymorphism  with  type  2  diabetic  patients  in  Indian 
population.
