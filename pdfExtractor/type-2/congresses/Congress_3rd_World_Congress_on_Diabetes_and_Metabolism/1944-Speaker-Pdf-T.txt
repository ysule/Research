Abstract 

Diabetes  mellitus  is  a  global  problem  so  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  education  related  to  Diabetes  Home  Care 
Management  and  prevention  of  diabetic  complications.    The  study  was  conducted  in  the  RIMS,  Imphal, 
comprising 300 diabetic patients (150 each as study and control), by Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) method. 
Administration  of  Interview  Schedule  and  Teaching  Module  were  conducted  among  the  study  group  in  the  first 
assessment. Only Teaching Module was conducted after 6 months. For control group, administration of Interview 
Schedule  in  the  first  assessment,  after  one  year  the  last  assessment  was  done  with  Proforma  and  Interview 
Schedule. HbA1c was found reduced in  both study and control group  from  the 1st assessment to 2nd assessment 
which was statistically significant in the study as well as in control group. In the study the total cholesterol, LDL-C 
and Triglyceride were significantly decreased by 13.4 mg/dl, 8.7mg/dl, and 13.2 mg/dl respectively except HDLC 
which is increased by 0.5 mg/dl in study group from 1st assessment to 2nd assessment. In control, total cholesterol, 
LDLC and Triglyceride were increased by 6.9 mg/dl, 5.3 mg/dl and 0.2mg/dl respectively except HDLC which is 
decreased by 2.3mg/dl from 1st assessment to 2nd. 

This  study  shows  improvement  in  glycaemic  control  and  diabetic  complications  among  the  study  group  who 
received  intervention  with  Directed  Diabetes  Home  Care  Management  compared  to  the  control  group  without 
intervention.
