Abstract 

Chronic hyperglycemia is a major inducer of diabetic retinopathy, a prominent microvascular complication of both 
type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the working age population for 
which unfortunately there is no preventative therapy. One of the fundamental changes closely associated with the 
development of diabetic retinopathy is the thickening of the basement membrane (BM) in the small blood  vessels 
of the diabetic retina. Several years of research has established hyperglycemia, the most prevalent characteristic of 
diabetes,  as  a  primary  causal  factor  mediating  this  alteration.  Studies  have  established  the  negative  impact  of 
hyperglycemia on the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy; however, the specific cellular mechanisms that lead to 
the  dysfunction  of  small  vessels  in  diabetes  are  unclear.In  particular,  it  is  unknown  if  vascular  BM  thickening 
promotes serious structural and functional abnormalities in the diabetic retina. While the association between BM 
thickening and the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy has been observed long ago, only recently 
new evidences have come to light that indicate vascular BM thickening plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of 
diabetic retinopathy. Our research has identified several BM genes, fibronectin, collagen IV, laminin, and cellular 
events  involving  connexin-43  gap  junction  intercellular  communication  that  are  significant  players  in  mediating 
hyperglycemia-driven  vascular  lesions.  These  changes  underlie  some  of  the  critical  pathogenetic  roles  played  by 
the thickened BM in promoting characteristic vascular lesions associated with diabetic retinopathy.
