Abstract 

The rhizome powder of an Indian  herb (presently  coded as CS0361) mostly  available in the eastern  Indian states 
including Assam, is widely used as folkloric anti-diabetic medicine. The anti-diabetic activity of the plant material 
has  been  confirmed  in  animal  models.  In  the  present  study  CS0361  has  been  tested  for  its  anti-hyperglycemic 
effect on type 2 diabetic subjects.  A single blind clinical trial was conducted on 30 subjects. Rhizome powder (4g) 
in warm water was given twice daily 30 mins before meal for 9 weeks. Blood glucose was measured by glucose-
oxidase  method  and  HbA1c  was  measured  by  ion  exchange  chromatography.  Paired‘t’  test  was  performed  to 
evaluate the statistical significance. 

Age  of the subjects was  49.9±2.5 years (M±SD)  and their BMI (kg/m2) was 23±2.63 at the  start and 22.4±2.5 at 
the  end  of  the  study.  The  CS0361  showed  significant  glucose  (mmol/l)  lowering  effect  on  fasting  condition 
compared to the  basal state (9.48±2.16) after 3rd week (8.56±1.75, p<0.001), 6th week (7.92±1.91, p<0.001) and 
9th week (8.08±1.58, p<0.001). Similar trend was also observed in the postprandial condition [basal vs 3rd week 
(13.5±1.87  vs  11.97±1.59,  p<0.001),  6th  week  (11.52±1.57,  p<0.001)  and  9th  week  (11.13±2.18,  p<0.001)]. 
Baseline and final HbA1c (M±SD) levels were 7.54±1.07 and 6.67±0.88 respectively, p<0.001. 

The  data  indicate  that  CS0361  posses  anti-hyperglycemic  agents,  which  needs  further  investigation  regarding 
chemical characterization and mechanism of action.
