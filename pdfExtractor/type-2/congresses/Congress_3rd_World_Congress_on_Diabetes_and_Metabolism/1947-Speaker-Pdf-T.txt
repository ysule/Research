Abstract 

Oxidative  stress  is  involved  in  the  pathophysiology  of  diabetes  mellitus  and  this  occurs  before  the  clinical 
appearance of late complications of diabetes.  This study was a cross-sectional study carried out in the Department 
of Biochemistry in collaboration with the Department of Medicine, Regional Institute of Medical Sciences, during 
the  period  from  October  2009  to  April  2011  to  estimate  the  level  of  Glutathione  Peroxidase(GPx)  and 
Malondialdehyde(MDA)  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus(DM)    with  and  without  complications  and 
healthy individuals. The study was carried out among  30 cases of type 2  DM  without complications and 30 type 
2 DM cases with microvascular complications. Thirty apparently healthy were taken as controls. Erythrocyte GPx 
and  MDA  levels  were  estimated  spectrophotometrically  using  Beckman  DU640  Spectrophotometer  using 
commercially  available  kit  RANSEL,  Randox  Lab  Ltd.  and  Bioxytech,  Oxis  International,USA  respectively. 
Patients with complications had longer duration of illness than those without complication. There was a significant 
decreased  in  the  level  of  GPx    among  the  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  with  complications  when  compared  to  those 
without  complication  and  also  controls  (19.18+0.97U/gHb,24.07+0.88U/gHb,29.48+0.92U/gHbrespectively). 
Increased lipid peroxidation  as indicated by  MDA level was observed in the cases when compared with controls. 
MDA  level  was  found  to  be  significantly  increased  in  those  with  complications(6.08+0.47µmol/l)  compared  to 
those  without  complication(4.01+0.22µmol/l)  and  controls(2.79+0.27µmol/l).The  study  showed  a  significant 
negative correlation between GPx and HbA1c and a positive correlation between MDA and HbA1c(p<0.01). This 
findings confirmed the evidence that diabetic patients are susceptible to oxidative stress and poor glycemic control 
had an association with free radical mediated lipid peroxidation
