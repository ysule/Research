Abstract 

Diabetic  nephropathy  is  the  most  common  cause  of  end  stage  kidney  disease,  and  the  leading  cause  of  death  in 
diabetic  patients.  The  present  study  was  undertaken  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  methanolic  extract  of  Emblica 
officinalis gaertn. (10 mg/kg, p.o) fruits by virtue of its hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and antioxidant activity that 
could  modulate  the  renal  lesions  associated  in  high  fat  diet/low  dose  streptozotocin  induced  diabetes  in 
experimental  animals.  The  study  also  investigates  the  combined  effect  of  Emblica  officinalis  gaertn  fruit  extract 
(EOE)  with  oral  hypoglycemic  agents  in  diabetes  induced  nephropathy.  The  results  showed  in  combination 
therapy  of    EOE  with  oral  hypoglycaemic  agents  was  more  effective  in  glycemic  control,  regaining  other 
parameters (body weight,  water intake, urine output, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, serum creatinine, blood urea 
nitrogen, urine glucose, urine creatinine mainly microalbuminuria and urine protein) to the normal range as in non 
diabetic  animals.  The  antioxidants  levels  ie  SOD  and  catalase  was  increased  and  TBARS  was  found  to  be 
decreased. From this study the regular consumption  of Emblica officinalis fruit (dietary source) could prevent the 
development of diabetes in prediabetic state
