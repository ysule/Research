  Abstract 

Obesity is a universal disease of increasing prevalence and recent evidence point to its association with vitamin A deficiency. 
Thus, besides the role of  vitamin A in several  key functions to the human  body, such as visual acuity, immune activity, cell 
proliferation  and  differentiation,  its  lack  may  be  associated  with  increased  adiposity.  Researches  has  suggested  that  such 
relationship  may  be  caused  due  to  the  modulating  action  of  this  vitamin  on  the  adipose  tissue.  This  process  would  mainly 
result  from  the  role  of  vitamin  A  in  activating  the  transcription  of  uncoupling  protein  1  (UCP1),  and  inhibiting  the 
differentiation of adipocytes with a consequent control of body fat when in high concentrations. Recently, this micronutrient 
has received attention for its role in fighting free radicals, protecting the body against oxidative stress associated with obesity 
and co-morbidities related to  it, preventing  damage and tissues injury and aggravation  involved in the installation of several 
chronic  diseases  not  transmitted.  The  Micronutrients  Research  Center  has  investigated  the  potential  effect  of  vitamin  A  in 
several metabolic conditions associated with obesity.
