Latinos are the largest and fastest growing ethnically diverse group in the U.S.; they are also the most overweight. Mexico is 
now second to the U.S. in suffering the worst epidemic of obesity in the world. Objectives of this study were to: 1) Conduct a 
systematic  review  of  obesity-related  interventions  targeting  Latinos  living  in  the  U.S.  and  Latin  America;  and  2)  Develop 
evidence-based recommendations to inform culturally relevant strategies targeting obesity. 

Obesity-related interventions, published between 1965 â€“2010, were identified through searches of major electronic databases. 
Selection  criterion  included:  evaluation  of  obesity-related  measures,  intervention  conducted  in  a  community  setting,  with  a 
sample of at least 50% Latino/Latin American participants, or with stratified results by race/ethnicity.  

Body of evidence was based on number of available studies, study design, execution, and effect size. Of 19,786 articles, 105 
interventions  met  final  inclusion  criteria.  Interventions  promoting  physical  activity  and/or  healthy  eating  had  strong  or 
sufficient evidence for recommending: (1) school-based interventions in the U.S. and (2) Latin America; (3) interventions for 
overweight or obese children in the healthcare context in Latin America; (4) individual-based interventions for overweight or 
obese adults in the U.S.; (5) individual-based interventions for adults in Latin America; and (6) healthcare-based interventions 
for overweight or obese adults in Latin America.
