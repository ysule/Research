Background 

Materials 

Type 2 diabetes remains a global concern with its numerical increase occurring in developing countries which include Nigeria 
and adipose tissue-secreted factors called “adipokines” are involved in energy homeostasis and regulation of glucose and lipid 
metabolism. Hence, this study was undertaken with the aim of investigating adipokine levels in the Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.   

This is a cross sectional study conducted in Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), a700 bed tertiary centre in the city 
of Lagos, Southwest Nigeria. 53 diabetic subjects with mean± standard deviation (56.72±10.44) and 27 non-diabetic controls 
(38.67±9.63) were recruited into the study. Fasting blood Glucose (FBG), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA₁C), leptin, and 
resistin were assayed. Body mass index (BMI) was also measured.   
 
Results 

Mean BMI was higher but not statistically significant in diabetics than in non diabetics (diabetics 28.77±5.35; non diabetics 
27.38±6.04; p > 0.05). This corroborates other studies that the higher level of adiposity predisposes higher level of FBG and 
HbA1C  and  to  the  incidence  of  DM  as  a  result  of  the  effect  of  increasing  fat  mass  on  insulin  sensitivity  [1,2].Resistin  was 
significantly higher in diabetics (diabetics 31.26±2.5; non diabetics 16.61±2.16; P < 0.01) compared to non-diabetics. Leptin 
correlated  very  strongly  with  BMI  (r  =  0.620,  p<  0.0001)  and  was  significantly  higher  in  females  than  males  (female: 
9.72±1.70;  male:  1.79±0.54;  p  <  0.0001)  which  agrees  with  the  study  conducted  by  Zimmet  and  Thomas  [3]. 
 
Conclusion 

This  study  concludes  that  circulating  adipokines  have  variable  effect  on  the  glucose  and  fat  metabolism.    BMI  and 
resistinlevels were higher in diabetics. Leptin was found in this study to correlate very strongly with BMI (adiposity). There 
was also a strong gender dependence observed as leptinlevel was signficantly higher in females than males.
