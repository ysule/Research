  Abstract 

Obesity is one of risk factors of various chronic diseases and malignancy. It may result from excess accumulation of body fat. 
This  condition  may  be  caused  by  dysfunction  of  appetite-regulating  pathways  and  energy  balance  due  to  leptin  resistance. 
Leptin, a 16 kDa hormone, is the most important regulator of appetite and energy balance in the body. Most individuals with 
obesity have leptin resistance characterized by increased leptin blood level. 

One  of  the  mechanisms  considered  to  have  a  role  in  leptin  resistance  is  disruption  in  signal  transduction  process  through 
Janus-activating  kinase2-signal  transducer  and  activator  of  transcription  3  (JAK2-STAT3)  pathway  on  leptin  receptors  by 
suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3).  

SOCS-3 is a  protein that  inhibits the signal transduction process  of various cytokines in  the body, including leptin. SOCS-3 
expression  is  induced  by  leptin  and  SOCS-3  activation  will  inhibit  STAT3  phosphorylation,  which  is  important  in  signal 
transmission  on  leptin  receptors.  Such  inhibition  will  consequently  cause  leptin  resistance  characterized  by  dysfunction  of 
leptin biological function. 

Biography 

Adisaputra  Ramadhinara,  MD  was  graduated  from  the  Faculty  of  Medicine,  University  of  Indonesia,  with  a  cum  laude 
appreciation. He is mainly interested in the mechanism behind leptin resistance, and is currently working on ideas that seem to 
be the right answer to normalize leptin function at the receptor site.
