  Abstract 

 
Biography 

What  is  a  safe,  achievable  and  clinically  meaningful  goal  for  weekly  weight  loss?  Both  health  care  professionals  and 
individuals  seeking  guidance  on  losing  excess  weight  ask  this  question.  The  answer  to  this  question  relies  on  carefully 
collected  data  and  accurate  mathematical  model  construction.  Advances  in  weight  loss  monitoring  technology,  clinical 
measurements,  and  computers  have  led  to  an  explosion  of  improved  mathematical  weight  loss  prediction  models.  In  this 
presentation, I will review mathematical models of human body weight regulation, and recent results from a clinical trial on 
model application to facilitate weight change. 

Diana  Thomas  received her  Ph.D. from the  Georgia Institute of Technology andis a Professor of Mathematics at  Montclair 
State University in New Jersey. For the past ten years, she has developed various mathematical models applied to biology and 
her research has appeared in journals such as Journal of Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Biosciences, Obesity Reviews, 
and  the  American  Journal  of  Clinical  Nutrition.  She  is  currently  part  of  several  NIH  funded  investigations  that  involve 
application of dynamic models to manage body weight.  She is the director for the Center for Quantitative Obesity Research at 
Montclair State University.
