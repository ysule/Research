  Abstract 

Methodology:  It  was  a  school  based,  cross  sectional  study  conducted  in  Karachi.  Study  population  was  school  children  of 
grade  9-10  (boys  and  girls).  Data  was  collected  through  self  administered  questionnaire  followed  by  anthropometric 
measurements.  Multistage  stratified,  cluster  sampling  technique  was  used.  Study  was  approved  from  Ethical  Review 
Committee  of  Aga  Khan  University.  Outcome  variable  “underestimation  of  body  weight”  was  assessed  by  students’  verbal 
response  and  actual  body  mass  index.  The  statistical  analysis  was  carried  out  on  software  SAS.  Multivariable  logistic 
regression technique was applied to determine the factors associated with underestimation of bodyweight. 

Results:  A total of 917 students participated from seventeen schools.  The mean (±SD) age of students was 15 (±1.3) years. 
Prevalence of overweight and obesity was found to be 8.6%, 3.6% respectively. The overall prevalence of underestimation of 
bodyweight was 14.7%. Among boys it was 20% (95% C.I:16.4-23.6), whereas among girls it was 9.1% (95% C.I:6.4-11.8). 
The  underestimation  of bodyweight  was associated with  male  gender [aOR=3.36 (95% C.I:1.41-8.00)], high socioeconomic 
status  [aOR=5.58  (95%  C.I:2.25-13.79)],  number  of  sibling  greater  than  three  [aOR=0.59  (95%  C.I:0.40-0.89)],  and 
overweight/obese students [aOR=11.54 (95% C.I:4.03-33.06)]. 

Conclusion:  The  high  prevalence  of  underestimation  of  body  weight  among  school  children  points  toward  urgent 
multifaceted  efforts  at  family,  schools  and  society  level.  This  will  prevent  childhood  morbidity  and  mortality  as  well  as 
adulthood obesity, chronic diseases and ultimate overall mortality.
