  Abstract 

Introduction:  During  gestation  diminished  maternal insulin sensitivity  (IS) increases the availability  of fuels allowing fetal 
growth.  Class  III  obesity  (OB;  BMI≥40kg/m2)  is  associated  with  reduced  IS  but  it  is  not  known  how  nutrient  availability 
differs and how this impacts on birth-weight versus normal pregnancies (CON).  

Methods: 239 OB (median (interquartile range) 43.2(41.1-46.3) kg/m2) and 105 CON (BMI 22.6(21.2-23.5)kg/m2) pregnant 
Caucasians  had  maternal  weight,  fasting  glucose,  non-esterified  fatty  acids  (NEFA)  and  insulin  concentrations  measured  at 
16, 28 and 36 weeks(wk). Premature births (<37 weeks) (4 OB, 1 CON) were excluded. 

Results: Weight gain (WG) was greater in CON vs. OB (10.4(7.6-13.0)kg vs. 5.2(2.4-8.3)kg; p<0.0001; 16-36wk). Glucose, 
NEFA and insulin were higher in OB vs. CON throughout pregnancy (p<0.0001). IS was lower in OB vs. CON (p<0.0001); 
in  CON  IS  was  lowest  at  36  weeks  whereas  in  the  OB,  IS  was  lowest  at  28  weeks.  Glucose  peaked  at  28wk:  OB  (16wk 
4.5(4.2-4.7)mmol/l; 28wk 4.6(4.3-4.9)mmol/l; 36wk 4.5(4.1-4.8)mmol/l; p=0.05) and CON (16wk 4.2(4.1-4.4)mmol/l; 28wk 
4.2(4.0-4.5)mmol/l;  36wk  4.1(3.9-4.3)mmol/l;  p=0.0003).  NEFA  fell  at  28wk:  OB  (16wk  0.49(0.41-0.60)mmol/l;  28wk 
0.44(0.37-0.55)mmol/l;  36wk  0.50(0.39-0.61)mmol/l;  p=0.005)  and  CON  (16wk  0.31(0.25-0.40)mmol/l;  28wk  0.29(0.22-
0.36)mmol/l;  36wk  0.33(0.27-0.46)mmol/l;  p=0.03).  Birth  weights  after  adjusting  for  confounders  were  greater  in  OB 
3610(3280-3980) g vs. CON 3600(3260-3860)g (p=0.03). In multivariate regression, increased 36wk glucosein OB (p=0.03) 
versus increased BMI and WG and diminished NEFA in CON were associated with increased birth-weight (all p<0.05). 

Conclusion:  OB  women  were  more  insulin  resistant  vs.  CON  during  pregnancy,  with  greater  glucose,  NEFA  and  insulin 
concentrations  and  greater  adjusted  birth-weights.  Increased  glucose  was  positively  associated  with  birth  weight  in  the  OB 
and diminished NEFA with birth weight in the CON which may indicate altered fetal preference for metabolites during these 
pregnancies.
