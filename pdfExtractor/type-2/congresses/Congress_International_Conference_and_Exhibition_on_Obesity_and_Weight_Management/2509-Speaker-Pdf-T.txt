The rapid development of overweight and obesity in China has brought about the increase of the prevalence of hypertension. 
Most  studies  on  blood  pressure  in  normotensive  women  showed  an  increase  in  blood  pressure  associated  with  hormone 
exposure.  The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  hormone  exposure  and  obesity,  and  their  joint  effects  on  the  risk  of 
hypertension  in  Chinese  women.  1,760  women  case-control  study  including  878  hypertensive  cases  and  882  normotensive 
controls was conducted in China. History of hormone exposure (combined oral contraceptive,COC) and relevant factors were 
investigated.  Body  weight,  height,  waist  circumference  (WC),  blood  pressure,  serum  lipids  and  apolipoproteins  were 
measured. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and pulation-attributable risk (PAR) was estimated. Our study 
showed  that  risk  factors for  hypertension  were: family  history  of  hypertension  (OR  2.28, 95%  CI 1.86-2.80;  PAR  32.71%), 
increased BMI (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.69-2.83; PAR 32.33%), increased waist circumference (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.13-1.88; PAR 
14.46%), dyslipidaemia (OR 1.34, 95% CI  1.08-1.67; PAR 16.36%), COC use (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.02-1.56; PAR 13.47%). 
Our results indicated that obesity, COC use and their joint effects significantly increased the risk of hypertension in Chinese 
women.  We  suggest  that  obese  women  wanting  to  use  COC  should  be  counseled  with  regard  to  possible  increased  risk  of 
CVD, and after weighing related risks and benefits, choose an effective and safe contraception method.
