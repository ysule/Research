Biography 

The use of exercise has become a staple in the  prevention and treatment options for the retarding the  development of health 
issues  pertaining  to  individuals  who  are  overweight,  overfatness  or  experience  obesity.  However,  there  are  few  studies  and 
reviews  look  at  the  global  issues  surrounding  the  metabolic  and  anabolic  hormone  consequences  of  overfatness  and  the 
interaction of exercise with adiposity in humans developing the health status for the individual.  This review offers an insight 
into the most recent understanding of health issues pertaining to metabolic and hormonal disruption related to overfatness and 
how exercise, particularly resistance exercise, can have a positive impact on resolving health issues for the overfat individual, 
regardless of body compositional changes, improving the responses to anabolic hormones at peripheral tissues leading toward 
a reduction of the diseased state and eventually a normalization of health status for the individual.  

James Clark has completed graduate course work in Physical Therapy from the University of Miami, Education from 
California Polytechnic University, Pomona and Integrative and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Southern 
California and prior to taking his teaching position at Manchester Community College began work toward his PhD in 
Kinesiology at the University of Connecticut .   He has published 8 (with 4 more in review)peer-reviewed papers, and has 
spoken to various organizations about exercise and health.  His research interest lies in the hormonal response of obese 
individuals to resistance training as a method for weight loss and health promotion.
