  Abstract 

Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but the mechanisms for increased CVD risk are still unclear. 
The present study aimed to examine associations of dietary intake and serum biomarkers of obesity with CVD mortality in a 
prospective study of 12,548 US adults aged ≥30 at baseline survey (1998-1994), and subsequent outcomes of coronary heart 
disease, stroke and total cardiovascular disease mortality over an average 12-year follow-up (2006). Reduced rank regression 
(RRR) modeling, an novel statistics method, was applied to create RRR scores that describe the associations of dietary intake 
(vitamins  C  and  D,  magnesium,  calcium,  sodium,  vegetable  protein,  dietary  fiber,  animal  protein  and  total  fat  intake)  and 
serum  biomarkers  (total  cholesterol,  LDL-C,  HDL-C,  triglycerides,  HbA1c,  CRP  and  fibrinogen).  Causes  of  death  were 
classified  using  ICD-10.  The  results  show  that  (1)  of  the  total  participants,  1,638  (M:  868,  F:  770)  died  from  CVD  (8.8%) 
during the follow-up period. Subjects with BMI≥30 kg/m2 (defined as obesity) had a significant higher risk of CVD mortality, 
and those with a higher RRR1 score (the primary score, a higher score indicating an increased profile of dietary disorder and 
serum biomarkers of obesity). The hazard ratios of obesity for CVD mortality was 1.31 (1.09-1.56) (p<0.01). As compared to 
the  first  quintile,  the  second  to  fifth  quintiles  of  the  RRR1  score  for  CVD  mortality  risk  were  0.93  (0.68-1.28),  1.00  (0.74-
1.34),  1.32  (1.03-1.68),  and  1.76  (1.33-2.32),  respectively  (trend  test,  p<0.001).  In  conclusion,  obesity-associated  dietary 
disorder and serum biomarkers significantly predicate risk of CVD mortality.
