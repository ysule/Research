  Abstract 

The  study  examined  the  relationship  of  lifestyle  factors  namely  food  intake,  exercise,  alcohol  consumption,  smoking  and 
stress and metabolic syndrome among faculty members in a Philippine university. A self-administered questionnaire was used 
to  gather  data  on  lifestyle.  Anthropometric  measurements  were  collected  using  standard  techniques.  Biochemical  data  were 
collected by trained health professionals and analyzed at the laboratory of the University Health Service in College, Laguna. A 
total of 100 full time faculty members selected through stratified random sampling by age served as respondents. The sampled 
faculty were classified into age groups to wit: young (20-39), middle-aged adults (40-59) and old adults (60 and above). Data 
were  analyzed  using  frequency  distribution  tables  and  spearmanâ€™s  correlation.  Results  revealed  that  the  prevalence  of 
metabolic syndrome based on NCEP ATP III criteria was 17 percent. Lifestyle factors such as intake of whole grains, sugars, 
fruits and vegetables, fish, oils and fats, and exercise had significant relationships with metabolic syndrome. Smoking, alcohol 
consumption and stress were found to have no significant relationship with metabolic syndrome.
