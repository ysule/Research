  Abstract 

Result:-  

Background: Obesity is a multi-factorial disease with excess of fat storage and leads to ailments like hypertension, diabetes, 
stroke and Cancer. Only diet & exercise does not help in reduction of adiposity in problematic areas like hips, thighs & 
abdomen. Various non â€“ invasive procedures like High Focalized Intensity Ultrasound (HIFU), Endermology, Mesotherapy 
and laser were used for lipolysis and lipo-mobilization 
Design: Randomized controlled, multicenter, multiracial study comparing effects of lipolysis with lymphatic drainage of fat, 
on fat percentage and waist circumference was carried out in men and women with BMI 28 to 30.

It was observed that average reduction in the waist circumference after one session of lipolysis was 2.029 cm and reduction in 
total body fat percentages by 1.1375. 
Conclusion: Combination of non invasive fat loss treatment of High Focalized Intensity Ultrasound (HIFU), Endermology, 
Mesotherapy and laser resulted in reduction of resistant fat which does not go with current treatment modalities of diet, 
exercise and pharmacotherapy and also reduces percentage of body fat. 
Limitations: Relation between reduction of waist circumference with non- invasive subcutaneous fat loss and health risk was 
not studied.
