The risk assessment started in 2009 and was supposed to conclude in 2015. But questions about whether or not glyphosate may cause cancer are dogging the agency’s review, and have slowed the process.\n\nOn Monday, after the contents of the documents started to generate questions from media, EPA yanked those documents from its website:\n\nAn agency spokeswoman said this:\n\n“Glyphosate documents were inadvertently posted to the Agency’s docket. These documents have now been taken down because our assessment is not final. EPA has not completed our cancer review. We will look at the work of other governments as well as work by HHS’s Agricultural Health Study as we move to make a decision on glyphosate. Our assessment will be peer reviewed and completed by end of 2016.”\n\nThe EPA said it was “working through some important science issues on glyphosate, including residues of the chemical in human breast milk;” an “in-depth human incidents and epidemiology evaluation;” and a preliminary analysis of glyphosate toxicity to milkweed, a critical resource for the monarch butterfly. \n\nInadvertent or not, one of those documents posted and then withdrawn was a doozy, a heavy hammer that seeks to knock down worries about glyphosate ties to cancer. The agency released an Oct. 1, 2015 internal EPA memorandum from its cancer assessment review committee (CARC) that contradicts the March 2015 finding by the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifying glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. EPA found instead that glyphosate is “Not Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans.”\n\nThe memorandum stated that the classification was based on “weight-of-evidence considerations.”\n\nCARC said this: “\n\nThe epidemiological evidence at this time does not support a causal relationship between glyphosate exposure and solid tumors. There is also no evidence to support a causal relationship between glyphosate exposure and the following non-solid tumors: leukemia, multiple myeloma, or Hodgkin lymphoma. The epidemiological evidence at this time is inconclusive for a causal or clear associative relationship between glyphosate and NHL. Multiple case-control studies and one prospective cohort study found no association; whereas, results from a small number of case-control studies (mostly in Sweden) did suggest an association.”\nMonsanto touted and tweeted the release of the document, which follows the release by EPA of a different memorandum supporting the safety of glyphosate last June. The newest memo gives the company added evidence to defend itself against a mounting stack of lawsuits filed by agricultural workers and others alleging Monsanto’s glyphosate-based Roundup herbicide gave them cancer.\n\n“This is the EPA’s highest ranking for product safety—they also do nice job of explaining all of IARC’s mistakes,” Monsanto Chief Technology Officer Robb Fraley said in a twitter posting.\n\nMonsanto has been calling on EPA to defend glyphosate against the cancer claims since the IARC classification came out in March 2015. A March 23, 2015 EPA email string released as part of a Freedom of Information request details Monsanto’s efforts to get EPA to “correct” the record on glyphosate “as it relates to carcinogenicity.”\n\nAnother document newly released by EPA - which was also then withdrawn - illustrates just why EPA’s risk assessment about the safety of glyphosate matters so much. In a memorandum dated Oct. 22, 2015, EPA detailed how extensively glyphosate is being used on food items.\n\nThat memo updates estimates of glyphosate use on crops in top agricultural states, and provides annual average use estimates for the decade 2004-2013. Seventy crops are on the EPA list, ranging alphabetically from alfalfa and almonds to watermelons and wheat. Glyphosate used on soybean fields, on an annual basis, is pegged at 101.2 million pounds; with corn-related use at 63.5 million pounds. Both those crops are genetically engineered so they can be sprayed directly with glyphosate as farmers treat fields for weeds. Cotton and canola, also genetically engineered to be glyphosate tolerant, also have high use numbers. But notable glyphosate use is also seen with oranges (3.2 million lbs); sorghum (3 million lbs); almonds (2.1 million lbs); grapes, (1.5 million lbs); grapefruit and apples (400,000 lbs each); and a variety of fruits, vegetables and nuts.\n\nDespite - or perhaps because of - the delays in issuing a final regulatory risk assessment on glyphosate, questions about the impact of the chemical on human health and the environment have been mounting. In addition to the lawsuits alleging glyphosate caused cancer in farm workers and others, private groups are scrambling to test a variety of food products for glyphosate residues.\n\nOn Friday a lawsuit with a new twist on glyphosate concerns was filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. That suit, which seeks class action status, alleges that glyphosate residues found in Quaker Oats invalidates claims by the Quaker Oats Co. that its product is wholly natural. “Glyphosate is a synthetic biocide and probable human carcinogen, with additional health dangers rapidly becoming known,” the lawsuit states. “When a product purports to be ‘100% Natural,’ consumers not only are willing to pay more for the product, they expect it to be pesticide-free,” the lawsuit states.\n\nQuestions about glyphosate have become so prevalent that U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu wrote a letter to EPA officials in December requesting EPA scientists meet with a group of independent scientists to go over “troubling information” related to glyphosate. Lieu cited concerns that EPA is relying on Monsanto-backed data rather than independent, peer-reviewed research in assessing glyphosate. Sources close to the situation say that meeting has been scheduled for June 14, though both EPA and Lieu’s office declined to comment.\n\nThe EPA’s diligence on digging into glyphosate questions and concerns is encouraging to those who want to see a thorough risk assessment done. But the delay and the questionable actions with releasing documents and then withdrawing them from the public eye does not inspire confidence.\n\nIndeed, in another curious move, the EPA on May 2 also issued a newly updated “registration review schedule.“ But while three dozen other chemical draft risk assessments are listed on the EPA website for release by the end of 2016, glyphosate was not included.\n\nOops?\n\nFollow Carey Gillam on Twitter: www.twitter.com/careygillam","link":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carey-gillam/what-is-going-on-with-gly_b_9825326.html","data":"By Carey Gillam:  \"On Friday, April 29, the EPA posted on its website a series of documents related to its long-awaited risk assessment for glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto's Roundup herbicide and other weed-killing products sold around the world.

A March 23, 2015 EPA email string released as part of a Freedom of Information request details Monsanto's efforts to get EPA to \"correct\" the record on glyphosate \"as it relates to carcinogenicity.\"\n\nAnother document newly released by EPA - which was also then withdrawn - illustrates just why EPA's risk assessment about the safety of glyphosate matters so much. In a memorandum dated Oct. 22, 2015, EPA detailed how extensively glyphosate is being used on food items.\n\nThat memo updates estimates of glyphosate use on crops in top agricultural states, and provides annual average use estimates for the decade 2004-2013. Seventy crops are on the EPA list, ranging alphabetically from alfalfa and almonds to watermelons and wheat. Glyphosate used on soybean fields, on an annual basis, is pegged at 101.2 million pounds; with corn-related use at 63.5 million pounds. Both those crops are genetically engineered so they can be sprayed directly with glyphosate as farmers treat fields for weeds. Cotton and canola, also genetically engineered to be glyphosate tolerant, also have high use numbers. But notable glyphosate use is also seen with oranges (3.2 million lbs); sorghum (3 million lbs); almonds (2.1 million lbs); grapes, (1.5 million lbs); grapefruit and apples (400,000 lbs each); and a variety of fruits, vegetables and nuts.\n\nDespite - or perhaps because of - the delays in issuing a final regulatory risk assessment on glyphosate, questions about the impact of the chemical on human health and the environment have been mounting. In addition to the lawsuits alleging glyphosate caused cancer in farm workers and others, private groups are scrambling to test a variety of food products for glyphosate residues.\n\nOn Friday a lawsuit with a new twist on glyphosate concerns was filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. That suit, which seeks class action status, alleges that glyphosate residues found in Quaker Oats invalidates claims by the Quaker Oats Co. that its product is wholly natural. \"Glyphosate is a synthetic biocide and probable human carcinogen, with additional health dangers rapidly becoming known,\" the lawsuit states. \"When a product purports to be '100% Natural,' consumers not only are willing to pay more for the product, they expect it to be pesticide-free,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nQuestions about glyphosate have become so prevalent that U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu wrote a letter to EPA officials in December requesting EPA scientists meet with a group of independent scientists to go over \"troubling information\" related to glyphosate. Lieu cited concerns that EPA is relying on Monsanto-backed data rather than independent, peer-reviewed research in assessing glyphosate. Sources close to the situation say that meeting has been scheduled for June 14, though both EPA and Lieu's office declined to comment.\n\nThe EPA's diligence on digging into glyphosate questions and concerns is encouraging to those who want to see a thorough risk assessment done. But the delay and the questionable actions with releasing documents and then withdrawing them from the public eye does not inspire confidence.\n\nIndeed, in another curious move, the EPA on May 2 also issued a newly updated \"registration review schedule.\" But while three dozen other chemical draft risk assessments are listed on the EPA website for release by the end of 2016, glyphosate was not included.\n\nOops?\n\nFollow Carey Gillam on Twitter: www.twitter.com/careygillam  Endocrine disruptors shared Institute for Responsible Technology's post.

The rate of increase is so great that genetic causes can't be the reason why,\" the professor said.\n\nIn the report, the researchers show that there are several disorders which are increasing and can be linked to endocrine disrupting substances:\n\nCancer – breast cancer, endometriosis, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and thyroid cancer increase.\nObesity and diabetes - these have increased over the past 40 years, especially type 2 diabetes, which has more than doubled since 1980.\nDecreasing male sperm counts and genital malformations, which are increasing among young boys.\nBirth defects – such as low birth weight and abrupt pregnancies - which have increased in many countries.\nPremature breast development among young girls, a phenomenon that can lead to breast cancer.\nThyroid problems, which are also increasing among children in some countries and can lead to behavioural disorders.\nEndocrine disrupting chemicals mainly enter the environment through industrial and urban discharges, agricultural run-off and the burning and release of waste. Human exposure can occur via the ingestion of food, dust and water, inhalation of gases and particles in the air, and skin contact with plastics and rubbers.\n\nKnown examples of endocrine disrupting chemicals include phthalates (a plastic-softener), brominated flame retardants (often used in household textile or furniture) and metals like lead and mercury.\n\nSome endocrine-disrupting chemicals occur naturally, while synthetic varieties can be found in pesticides, electronics, personal care products and cosmetics. They can also be found as additives or contaminants in food.\n\n\"Of greatest significance is that we now know that there are particularly vulnerable periods during fetal and postnatal life when endocrine-disrupting chemicals alone, or in mixtures, have strong and often irreversible effects on developing organs, whereas exposure of adults causes lesser or no effects,\" the authors write.\n\n\u003e\u003e Read: EU-funded research shows mothers, children exposed to chemicals\n\nMore research needed\n\nWhen it comes to testing, the authors say that known endocrine-disrupting chemicals are only the ‘tip of the iceberg’ and more comprehensive testing methods are required to identify other possible endocrine disruptors, their sources, and routes of exposure.\n\nMore scientific evidence is also needed to identify the effects of mixtures of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on humans and mainly from industrial byproducts to which humans are increasingly exposed.\n\nCefic, the European Chemical Industry Council, said this was exactly the problem with the new report. The paper links several effects on human to environmental exposure to chemicals, without sufficient proof of a causal relationship, they say, ignoring the role played by other factors such as lifestyle.\n\n\"The report fails to meet the standards expected for sound scientific work,\" said Cefic's Director General Hubert Mandery.\n\nCefic encourages governments and intergovernmental agencies to use consistent and objective criteria for evaluating studies and a transparent framework for evaluating the overall weight of scientific evidence.\n\nWake-up call for the EU\n\nHowever, Sylvia Maurer, safety and environment senior policy officer at the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), called the UNEP and WHO report a \"landmark study\".\n\nAccording to BEUC, the report alerts policy makers to the risks associated with chemicals that can interfere with hormonal actions, and currently lack adequate safeguards.\n\n\"Every day, consumers are in contact with products that contain chemicals which have not been sufficiently tested for their safety,\" Maurer said. \"This is a tremendous problem for our society knowing that these hazardous chemicals may be linked to the formation and increase in severe and chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and obesity.\"\n\n\"The authors of the study explain very clearly that current risk assessment and risk management methods give false assurances of safety. We basically underestimate the real risks of disease related to endocrine disruptors,\" the BEUC policy officer added.\n\nIn 2006, the European Commission adopted the REACH regulation, which requires chemical manufacturers to register 30,000 out of the 100,000 or so substances currently on the market and submit them for safety screening and subsequent authorisation.\n\nThose that are considered to pose an unacceptable threat to human health or the environment may be phased out and eventually replaced.\n\nPOSITIONS: \nLena Ek, Sweden's minister for the environment, said:\n\n\"It is time to speed up the phasing-out the most problematic endocrine disruptors. Bisphenol A that is used in many plastics is a clear candidate. In the EU, we decided in 2010 to a ban BPA in baby feeding bottles. In Sweden, we have banned its use in food containers for children under three. Industry has been able to find alternative materials. We are now discussing the possibility for a total ban of BPA use in Sweden, with receipts and material in contact with food as a priority. I hope that other countries as well as companies will take similar action on BPA, and other known endocrine disrupting chemicals, and to use the precautionary principle.\"\n\nLisette van Vliet, Ph.D. and senior policy adviser of Chemicals and Chronic Disease Prevention at the Health \u0026 Environment Alliance (HEAL), told EurActiv:\n\n\"The report is a timely confirmation that the EU is facing a crucial opportunity to effectively deal with endocrine disrupting chemicals - the Commission has forthcoming proposals – first, on how the EU should tackle endocrine disrupting chemicals in a coherent overarching policy (the EU endocrine disrupting chemicals strategy); and second how the EU should identify endocrine disrupting chemicals so that they can be banned, phased out or otherwise properly managed (the criteria to identify, risk assess and test for endocrine disrupting chemicals). The response to and application of the EU strategy and criteria by Member states and the companies which produce or use these chemicals will also be vital to reducing people's exposures.\"\n\nThe International Chemical Secretariat (ChemSec) said the UNEP and WHO report highlights the need for all stakeholders to act to limit human exposure of endocrine disrupting chemicals.\n\n\"In the EU there is an on-going process of agreeing on criteria for endocrine disruptors, and it is highly important that the outcome of this process will be inclusive and efficient criteria, taking into account the built-in problems with endocrine disrupting chemicals such as low-dose effects,” Anne-Sofie Andersson, ChemSec's director, told EurActiv.\n\nSylvia Maurer, safety and environment senior policy officer at the European consumer organisation BEUC, told EurActiv: \"The report rightly calls on policy makers to reduce exposure to those hormone-disturbing chemicals and to even consider bans and restrictions of some hazardous chemicals.\"\n\n\"It is of particular importance to better protect vulnerable consumers such as pregnant women, babies and young children as it has been found that the effects of endocrine disrupters during these crucial stages of human development can have life-long negative health consequences. Consumers’ exposure to chemicals in everyday products such as toys, textiles, plastic items, cosmetics and furniture needs to be reduced,\" Maurer added.\n\nExecutive Director of UNEP Achim Steiner said: “Chemical products are increasingly part of modern life and support many national economies, but the unsound management of chemicals challenges the achievement of key development goals, and sustainable development for all.\"\n\n“Investing in new testing methods and research can enhance understanding of the costs of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, and assist in reducing risks, maximising benefits and spotlighting more intelligent options and alternatives that reflect a transition to a green economy,” Steiner added.\n\n“We urgently need more research to obtain a fuller picture of the health and environment impacts of endocrine disruptors,” said Maria Neira, WHO’s director for Public Health and Environment.\n\n“The latest science shows that communities across the globe are being exposed to endocrine disrupting disorders, and their associated risks.

According to the CDC, exposure to phthalates is wide spread and animal studies show that they are toxic to reproductive system and have other effects. Studies show that phthalates reduce female fertility and can cause premature breast development in young women. Phthalates in a mother’s body can effect the fetal development of her child. Baby boys whose mothers were exposed to high levels of phthalates are more likely to have altered genital development (2004 University of Rochester study) and altered levels of testosterone. For men, phthalates lower sperm counts, reduce sperm motility, and damage sperm. Endocrine disrupting chemicals have been linked to obesity. Several animal studies show that exposing mice to endocrine disruptors, including phthalates, causes them to become more obese. A 2008 study by the Environmental Working Group detected 7 out of 7 phthalates in all 20 of the 20 teen girls tested. Phthalates are not regulated by the U.S. federal government. In 2004, the European Union banned the use of bibutyl phthalate (DBP) and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) from personal care products. California state placed DEHP on its Prop 65 list of chemicals known to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity.\nused in:\nPhthalates are used to make plastics soft and flexible.

Scientific studies link BPA to accelerated puberty, breast cancer, changes in behavior, obesity, and diabetes. Scientists found that BPA caused human breast cancer cells to grow and replicate in the lab. Studies also show that BPA can lead to female reproductive problems, changes in fertility, and altering of mammary glands. Animal studies show that mice exposed to BPA in the womb had accelerated puberty and altered female reproductive systems. Even low doses can have effects the endocrine system. In 2004, the CDC found BPA in 93% of urine tested from a sample size representative of the U.S. population. Several U.S. companies have removed BPA from their water bottles and baby bottles because of growing health concerns and consumer requests. The U.S. federal government does not regulate BPA, however states and local municipalities are taking action. The City of Chicago and Suffolk County in New York have banned the sale baby bottles and sippy cups with BPA. The State of Connecticut has banned infant formula cans, baby food jars, and reusable food and beverage containers containing BPA.

BPA is added to hard plastic bottles. Due to the health problems caused by BPA, many companies have removed it from their products. Look for BPA-free labels or use only #1, #2, #4, #5 plastics for food and drinks. \nEat less canned food.

Exposure to PFCs reduces a woman’s fertility. Fetuses are exposed to PCFs through the placenta and umbilical cord. Maternal exposure to PFCs before and during pregnancy can lead to lower births weights and may affect organ and skeletal growth of the fetus. Animal studies show that PFCs lead to increased rate miscarriages and neonatal deaths in mice. PFOA induced testicular, pancreatic, mammary and liver tumors in rats. In 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency classified PFOA as a “likely human carcinogen.” In a 2004 study by the CDC they detected the PFCs: PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA in more than 98% of the samples from a group representative of the U.S. population.

If you use skin disinfectant, use an alcohol rub or rinse.\nAvoid “antibacterial” dishwashing and cleaning products. \nAvoid products that say “protection against mold”, “odor fighting”, or keeps food fresher, longer.” These claims may, but not always, indicate the presence of triclosan.\nmore resources:\nCDC’s Antibacterial Household Products: Cause for Concern http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no3_supp/levy.htm\nEnvironmental Working Group’s Guide to Triclosan http://www.ewg.org/node/26721\n\n\n\nParabens\non the label:\nmethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparapen and ethylparaben\nhealth effects:\n Parabens are synthetic estrogens, meaning that they act like estrogen in your body and disrupt your hormone system. Studies show that parabens are linked to breast cancer. A 2002 study found that parabens stimulate the growth of estrogen sensitive breast cancer cells. A 2004 study found parabens in breast cancer tumors from 19 of 20 women studied. According to the Breast Cancer Fund, six different parabens have been identified in breast cancer tumors. The parabens found in the tumors were in relative concentrations that are similar to their use in cosmetic products. A 2006, CDC study found parabens in almost all urine samples examined from a demographically diverse sample of U.S. adults. This indicates widespread exposure of parabens in the U.S. population. The European Union banned the use of sodium methylparaben in fragrance due to its ability to strip skin of pigment and other health concerns.\nused in:\nAccording to the FDA, parabens are the most widely used type of preservative in cosmetics.\nShampoos, conditioners\nSunscreens\nDeodorants/antiperspirants\nToothpastes\nA preservative in food\nreduce your exposure to parabens: \nChoose paraben-free cosmetic products.

EDs are hormone-mimicking, chemical compounds which interfere with and wreak havoc on your bodyâs normal hormone function (making them do things they shouldnât) like stimulating cancer development and triggering immunity, fertility, metabolic, developmental and cognitive problems just to name a few (while stopping them from doing what they should be doing) namely protecting you from the aforementioned and keeping your bodyâs natural hormones balanced.A few of the most common EDs on the âmust avoidâ list: BPA (bisphenol-A), parabens, phthalates, PBDE’s (polybrominated diphenyl ethers), mercury, lead, pesticides and herbicides. Problem is, avoiding them is easier said than done as EDs are all over the place, lurking in many everyday items such as food, personal care products, sunscreen, perfume, antibacterial washes, household cleaners, laundry products, vinyl shower curtains, plastic toys, electronics, household dust, bug sprays â the list goes on and on!In short thereâs virtually no escaping EDs completely but you can significantly cut your exposure, starting with these easy-to-implement 15 tips:In the BathroomTrade in your vinyl shower curtain for an environmentally kinder fabric one, which wonât pollute the indoor air like off-gassing, BPA-laden vinyl will.Let go of liquid soaps, particularly the anti-bacterial ones. Many of them contain endocrine-disrupting triclosan. Castile soap and hot water will do the job just as well, without harming you or the environment.Dump shampoos, conditioners, body washes and moisturizers if phthalates or parabens are listed on the label.Love the perfumed smell of lavender or peppermint in your personal care products? Beware, because those synthetic fragrances often come complete with a big dose of EDs! If you want fragrance that really is fragrance, look for products scented with essential oils, or add your own.With personal care products, keep in mind that most Â (even those marked ânaturalâ or |organicâ) may contain EDs like phthalates and parabens, so read the label closely.Also beware of the generic term âfragrance.â Itâs a catch-all phrase often used by personal-care product manufacturers to disguise their endocrine-disrupting ingredients.While the FDA may consider them safe, many cosmetics contain high levels of endocrine disruptors. If you wish to avoid them, minimize your make-up routine, use as little as possible and look for organic cosmetics.Keep sunscreen use to a minimum as they are packed with EDs and not-so-good-for-you chemicals. Instead, select organic, chemical-free versions, and apply sparingly.Around the HouseOne of the best things you can do to reduce the EDs in your home? Buy a high-quality, high-power vacuum, preferably one that seals in dirt and dust to help minimize your exposure when emptying the collection chamber. Turns out household dust and dirt is thought to be one of the biggest sources of daily ED exposure.If you need one more reason to get rid of that old couch or chair, here it is: most furniture manufactured before 2005 received a coat of endocrine-disrupting flame-retardants before they left the factory, and who wants to sit in that? Drag the old stuff to the curb as soon as you can and replace with minimally-treated, untreated or organic pieces.When itâs time to upgrade the mattress, ditch the memory foam and trade it in for a healthy version, like a futon or untreated mattress. Click here for ideas on how to sleep cleaner and greener.Older computers, printers and TVs were manufactured with endocrine-disrupting flame retardants like PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) or soon-to-be-phased out decaBDE. If youâre not upgrading your electronics soon, then at least get them out of the bedroom and into a well-ventilated area to help limit exposure, particularly when youâre snoozing.Your kitchen is a hotbed of EDs. To get them out of your food, check out my post on 15 Ways to Reduce Endocrine Disruptors in Your Kitchen.In the Great OutdoorsWeed and pest-killers are loaded with EDs â and I think nobody should use them at all! If you must have that perfect lawn and bug-free back yard, buy non-toxic alternatives to protect yourself, your family, property and the creatures who share it from pesticide-induced endocrine disruption.Still barbequing as the last rays of summer are fading? Perhaps itâs time to hang up your tongs â if for no other reason than to curb exposure to endocrine-disrupting PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) which turn up in significant amounts in grilled foods (particularly when over-cooked or charred).For more ideas, on healthier Skincare, click here and to check out what chemicals to try avoid in your personal care products, click here.For a list of the 12 worst Endocrine Disrupters, how they do their dirty deeds, and some more tips on how to avoid them, check out “Dirty Dozen Endocrine Disruptors”.

(Scheve, 2014)\nMost of us apply parabens to our skins and perhaps even consume them daily. They’re ingredients in:  (Scheve, 2014) (personal observation)\n \n\nCosmetics – such as moisturizers, lipsticks, lip balms, foundations, concealers, eye make ups, make up removers, self-tanners, hair dyes\nHygiene products – such as shampoos, conditioners, de-frizzers, volumizers, hair dyes, soaps, toothpastes, topical ointments, deodorants and anti-perspirants, shaving gels, sunscreens, anti-wrinkle creams, bandages and eye drops, personal lubricants, estrogen creams\nFood products – such as salad dressing, mayonnaise, mustard, processed vegetables, frozen dairy products, soft drinks, baked goods and jellies\nPharmaceuticals – such as ointments and other products\nHousehold and industrial products – such as textiles and glues\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHOW CHEMICAL ENDOCRINE DISRUPTERS ARE HARMFUL\nThe 8 glands in our endocrine systems produce and release hormones that regulate metabolism, growth, development, tissue function, sleep, reproduction, sexual function and mood. Almost every cell in the body is affected by the endocrine system. A report issued in March 2013 jointly by the United Nations and the World Health Organization states that “Endocrine Disrupters (EDC’s) are a global threat to fertility and the environment.”\nAnd a recent report from the Environmental Working Group says:\nThere is no end to the tricks that endocrine disruptors can play on our bodies–increasing production of certain hormones, decreasing production of others, imitating hormones, turning one hormone into another, interfering with hormone signaling, telling cells to die prematurely, competing with essential nutrients, binding to essential hormones, and accumulating in organs that produce hormones.\n(Anderson, 2014)\n \n8 Glands in the Endocrine System\n \n \n \n \nCHEMICAL NAMES OF PARABENS\nThese are various names of the parabens we’re absorbing or ingesting from products – if they’re ingredients in your products, you’ll usually find them listed toward the bottom of the list:  (Lal, 2012)\n\nBenzyl-parahydroxybenzoic acid\nButylparaben\nButyl-parahydroxybenzoic acid\nEthylparaben\nEthyl-parahydroxybenzoic acid\nIsobutylparaben\nIsopropylparaben\nMethylparaben\nMethyl-parahydroxybenzoic acid\nParahydroxybenzoate\nParahydroxybenzoic acid\n\nPropylparaben\nPropyl-parahydroxybenzoic acid\n\n \nJapanese Honeysuckle Extract\nJapanese Honeysuckle\nSeveral authors have noted that a growing number of beauty product companies are trying to make their products safer and have substituted Japanese honeysuckle extract for chemical parabens. This has led to some controversy since the preservative made from Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera Japonica)  is actually a form of paraben and behaves in a very similar way to synthetic parabens. Honeysuckle extract is marketed as Plantservative. (Marta, 2012)\nThere’s hope: Some cosmetics companies are replacing parabens with grapefruit seed extract and Vitamin E; and essential oils like cinnamon, eucalyptus, lavender, lemon and tea tree are being distilled and turned into natural preservatives. (Lal, 2012)\n \n \n \n\n \nThe US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that parabens have hormone-disrupting qualities that mimic estrogen, interfering with the body’s endocrine system. The EPA has linked methylparabens in particular to metabolic, developmental, hormonal and neurological disorders, as well as to various cancers – especially breast cancer. (Mercola, 2012) (Johnson, 2011) For more information on a parabens-breast cancer link, see the Environmental Working Group’s  EWG’s Skin Deep Database, and the articles by Mercola and Johnson.\n\n \n\n\n \nThere is evidence that the estrogen-mimicry effect of parabens  decreases testosterone levels, sperm counts and daily production of sperm in rats. Testosterone was found to decrease in a dose-dependent manner related to paraben concentration. It is thought that parabens are also responsible for the increasingly early onset of puberty in children, damage to the DNA in sperm, and damage to mitochondrial function, causing male infertility. (Osman, 2012)\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTHE UNREGULATED COSMETICS INDUSTRY\nFrom Safe Cosmetics (Breast Cancer Action, 2014):\nBecause testing is voluntary and controlled by the cosmetic manufacturers, many ingredients in cosmetic products are not tested for safety. The Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep states that 89 percent of ingredients used in personal care products have not been evaluated for safety by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) panel, the FDA, or any other publicly accountable institution (FDA 2000, CIR 2002). The absence of governmental oversight for this $35 billion industry means that companies routinely market products with ingredients that are poorly studied, not studied at all, or worse, known to pose potentially serious health risks. It’s time to protect consumers….\nMany cosmetic companies argue that the level of a harmful chemical in any one product is not enough to harm you…. However, science is finding the timing of exposure is critical, and that even a very small dose of some chemicals can have serious consequences in children and young women who are still developing.\nMoreover, we are rarely exposed to a chemical just one time. We may use the same product every day, several days a week, for months or years. In addition, we use dozens of personal care products daily, not just one. So while exposure from one product on one day may be small, we in fact use numerous products a day for extended periods of time. As a result, scientists are finding accumulations of chemicals such as parabens and phthalates in our bodies.\nThe unregulated cosmetics industry has publicly assessed only 11% of the 10,500 ingredients in personal care products. (The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, 2011)\nSee the  Campaign for Safe Cosmetics website for ways to take action.\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nSKIN DEEP: A USEFUL COSMETIC SAFETY DATABASE\n\n\n \nThe Campaign for Safe Cosmetics partners with the Environmental Working Group to produce a cosmetic safety database. You can visit EWG’s Skin Deep Database to check the ingredients in the products you use or to find safer products for you and your family.\nThis searchable database checks the ingredients in more than 74,000 shampoos, makeups, deodorants, sunscreens and other personal care products with 50 toxicity and regulatory databases.\nThere’s even an iPhone and Android mobile app for their database so you can check out products while you’re shopping. The app has some nice features:\n\n\nIt lets you scan products’ barcodes to see EWG’s score for them.\n\n\nWith its History feature, you can find the scores of products you’ve previously scanned.\n\n\nYou can save your Favorites so you can easily check their scores.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nTHINK BEFORE YOU PINK\nBreast Cancer Action coined the term pinkwasher in 2003 to refer to cosmetic and body care companies that promote pink ribbon products while also selling products that contribute to the disease.  BCA first challenged Avon and then went on to focus on other companies that raise money in the name of breast cancer but manufacture body care products containing known carcinogens or reproductive toxins – such as parabens and phthlates.

What are some of the most harmful ingredients in products? \nA. Mercury (often listed as thimerosal on ingredient labels), found in some eye drops, ointment and deodorants; lead acetate, found in some hair dyes and cleanser; formaldehyde and toluene, found in nail products; petrochemicals, found in some hair relaxers, shampoos, mascara, perfume, foundation, lipstick and lip balm; coal tar, found in dandruff shampoos, anti-itch creams and hair dyes; placenta, found in some hair relaxers, moisturizers and toners; and phthalates, found in some nail polish, fragrances and hair spray. \nAll of these ingredients can be found in our brochure, Unmasked: 10 Ugly Truths Behind the Myth of Cosmetic Safety.\nQ. So I should buy products labeled “all-natural”? \nA. Looking for the words “natural” or “safe” won’t guarantee that the product you buy really is safe. That’s why we’re asking all manufacturers to sign the Compact for Safe Cosmetics and pledge not to use chemicals linked to cancer, birth defects and other health harms and replace them with safer alternatives. \nQ: I don’t see Arbonne, Avon, Mary Kay, Melaleuca or other similar companies listed on your website, even though they claim to be “safe,” “natural” or donate money to breast cancer research. What’s the deal? \nA: Arbonne, Avon, Mary Kay and Melaleuca are aware of the Compact for Safe Cosmetics but have refused to sign it. If they are truly supporting women’s health and making “safe” products, it shouldn’t be too hard for them to sign the Compact. Hundreds of companies have signed the Compact, a commitment to manufacture personal care products free of known and suspected toxic chemicals. \nThe Campaign for Safe Cosmetics does not endorse or hand-pick “safe” companies to refer customers to. The growing list of safer companies on our Web site is comprised solely of companies that have signed the Compact for Safe Cosmetics. If you don’t see a company on the list, we encourage you to send a letter letting them know about the Compact and urging them to sign it. \nFor a sample letter to get you started, please check out the Materialssection of the website. \nQ: How do I know if a particular product is safe? \nA: To find safety information on specific products, check out EWG’s Skin Deep, the online database of nearly 25,000 personal care products. You can search the database for specific brands or ingredients, or for product types, like nail polish, to see how brands within that product class compare. Skin Deep will also tell you if a company has signed the Compact for Safe Cosmetics. We recommend supporting Compact signers over non-signers when possible because Compact-signing companies have made a meaningful commitment to create safer products. \nQ. What are phthalates? Where are they found? \nA. Phthalates (pronounced THA-lates) are plasticizing chemicals that are probable human reproductive or developmental toxins and endocrine disruptors. Phthalates cause reproductive birth defects in laboratory animals, particularly males. \nTwo phthalates often used in cosmetics (dibutyl and diethylhexyl) have been banned in the European Union. Unfortunately, phthalates are still found in some nail polishes and hair sprays, and are commonly hidden on ingredient labels under the term “fragrance.” We recommend that consumers steer clear of products with fragrance, especially pregnant women, babies and pubescent young adults. \nFor more information, please read our reports, “A Little Prettier” (2008) and “Not Too Pretty” (2002). \nQ. I’ve been reading a lot about parabens and companies going “paraben-free.” What does that mean? \nA. Parabens are a group of compounds widely used as anti-microbial preservatives in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics products, including underarm deodorants. Parabens are absorbed through intact skin and through the gastrointestinal tract and blood. U.K. researchers found measurable concentrations of six different parabens in 20 human breast tumors. The study highlights the need for more research on the potential link between products containing parabens and increased breast cancer risk. \nMany companies, including Compact signers, have begun phasing out parabens from their lines by marking their products as “paraben-free.” Parabens are commonly listed on product ingredient labels as methylparaben, propylparaben, ethylparaben and butylparaben.\nQ. What about nail polish? \nA. So many people have asked us about nail polish that we created a separate pagefor information about it. According to EWG’s Skin Deep database of cosmetic product safety, nail polish is among the highest-concern product categories in terms of serious health effects. This has to do in large part to the chemicals formaldehyde, toluene and dibutyl phthalate(DBP), all three of which make it into the top ingredients of concern in personal care products, and all three of which could be found in many brands of nail polish until very recently. \nMany smaller nail polish manufacturers removed these chemicals from their products long ago. And while European laws forced many international companies to stop using DBP in 2005, some holdouts were still using the chemical in their U.S. lines. In 2006, Del Laboratories, Inc., which makes the Sally Hansen brand, told the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics that it would remove all DBP, toluene and formaldehyde from their U.S. products. At that time, leading salon brand (and target of Campaign actions and ads) OPI agreed to remove DBP, but refused to eliminate formaldehyde and toluene from all of their nail polishes and treatments. \nIn March 2007, OPI reported that it was reformulating all of its products to be toluene-free.\nThe U.S. National Toxicology Program says formaldehyde is “reasonably anticipated” to be a human carcinogen. Meanwhile, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) restricts toluene in drinking water because it can cause nervous system disorders and damage the liver and kidneys. DBP is prohibited for use in cosmetics in the European Union because it is a possible human reproductive or developmental toxin. The data from several peer-reviewed scientific studies indicated that DBP is a probable endocrine disruptor, which means that it disrupts the natural balance of hormones in the body.\nQ. Who’s making safe nail polish? \nA. Several companies who have signed the Compact make nail polishes, treatments and removers without harmful chemicals, including Anise Nail Care, Honeybee Gardens and NAIL-AID Treatments. So you don’t have to give up your mani-pedi visits, just BYOP (Bring Your Own Polish) the next time you go! And it won’t hurt to let your salon know about the health effects associated with polishes and treatments and how they can swap toxic products with safer alternatives to protect their own health, too. For more information about health risks to salon workers, read Glossed Over: Health Hazards Associated with Toxic Exposure in Nail Salons from Women’s Voices for the Earth. \nQ: Where can I find information on sunscreens? \nA: Environmental Working Group’s 2011 investigationof more than 600 sunscreen products found that 4 out of 5 contain chemicals that may pose health hazards or don’t adequately protect skin from the sun’s damaging rays. Some sunscreen makers are using nanotechnology in their products, and not always telling consumers about these risky nano-sized ingredients. Friends of the Earth published a report in 2007 focusing on nanotechnology and sunscreen, which is available on their website.\nQ: Can I really get exposed to as much formaldehyde eating Brussels sprouts or apples as I can from a Brazilian Blowout treatment?\nA:  In a word, no. This is a myth perpetuated by defenders of Brazilian Blowout and other keratin hair-straightening products. Apples and some other fruits and vegetables do contain naturally occurring formaldehyde, typically around 10 mg/kg (or parts per million), or 0.001 percent. But the levels of formaldehyde found in Brazilian Blowout by Oregon OSHA in 2010 were close to 10 percent, 10,000 times higher than the levels of formaldehyde found in apples.\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOME LABELS INDICATING A PRODUCT IS PARABEN FREE\n \n\n \n \n\n \nCheck the products you use to see if they have earned any of these labels.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOTHER BAD STUFF IN OUR COSMETICS\nFor the sake of simplicity, I decided to focus on parabens in this post but there are many other problematic chemicals included in the products we use on and put into our bodies.\nThe ingredients below are often found in skin moisturizers and other personal care products:\nReprinted from Do Your Skincare Products Contain These Chemicals? (Belanger, 2008)\nMineral Oil, Paraffin, and Petrolatum — Petroleum products that coat the skin like plastic, clogging pores and creating a build-up of toxins, which in turn accumulate and can lead to dermatologic issues. Slows cellular development, which can cause you to show earlier signs of aging. Suspected cause of cancer. Disruptive of hormonal activity. By the way, when there’s an oil spill in the ocean, don’t they rush to clean it up — fast? Why put that stuff on your skin?\nParabens — Widely used as preservatives in the cosmetic industry (including moisturizers). An estimated 13,200 cosmetic and skin care products contain parabens. Studies implicate their connection with cancer. They have hormone-disrupting qualities — mimicking estrogen — and interfere with the body’s endocrine system.\n\nPhenol carbolic acid– Found in many lotions and skin creams. Can cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma and even death from respiratory failure.\nPropylene glycol — Used as a moisturizer in cosmetics and as a carrier in fragrance oils. Shown to cause dermatitis, kidney or liver abnormalities, and may inhibit skin cell growth or cause skin irritation.\nAcrylamide– Found in many hand and face creams. Linked to mammary tumors in lab research.\nSodium laurel or lauryl sulfate (SLS), also known as sodium laureth sulfate (SLES)– Found in car washes, engine degreasers, garage floor cleaners… and in over 90% of personal care products! SLS breaks down the skin’s moisture barrier, easily penetrates the skin, and allows other chemicals to easily penetrate. Combined with other chemicals, SLS becomes a “nitrosamine”, a potent class of carcinogen. It can also cause hair loss. SLES is sometimes disguised with the labeling “comes from coconut” or “coconut-derived”.\nToluene — Poison! Danger! Harmful or fatal if swallowed! Harmful if inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Made from petroleum or coal tar, and found in most synthetic fragrances. Chronic exposure linked to anemia, lowered blood cell count, liver or kidney damage, and may affect a developing fetus. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) contains toluene. Other names may include benzoic and benzyl.\nDioxane– Found in compounds known as PEG, Polysorbates, Laureth, ethoxylated alcohols. Common in a wide range of personal care products. The compounds are usually contaminated with high concentrations of highly volatile 1,4-dioxane, easily absorbed through the skin. Dioxane’s carcinogenicity was first reported in 1965 and later confirmed in studies including one from the National Cancer Institute in 1978. Nasal passages and liver are the most vulnerable. Dioxane is easily removed during the manufacturing process by “vacuum stripping”. Warning: It is a synthetic derivative of coconut. Watch for hidden language on labels, such as “comes from coconut”.\n\nPhthalates\nLike parabens, phthalates are also known to be hormone-mimicking chemicals which disrupt normal hormonal processes. And, also like parabens, they are frequently included in our cosmetic and body care products. Phthalates have been found to cause a broad range of birth defects and lifelong reproductive problems in laboratory animals exposed to them during pregnancy and after birth.  The US Environmental Protection Agency lists phthalates as “Chemicals of Concern”.  (Think Before You Pink)\nPhthalates are esters of phthalic acid used principally as plasticizers to increase flexibility, transparency, durability and longevity in a large variety of products – including personal-care products, nail polish, fragrances, enteric coatings on pharmaceutical tablets and nutritional supplements, detergents and surfactants, packaging materials, PVC shower curtains, pharmaceuticals, food products, children’s toys, paints, printing inks, lubricants, emulsifying agents, adhesives and glues, vinyl flooring, electronics, building materials, medical devices, food additives, textiles, and inert ingredients in pesticides. (Wikipedia, 2014)\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found most of the people they tested in the US had metabolites of multiple phthalates in their urine. Recent human bio-monitoring data found the “tolerable intake” of phthalates for children to be far exceeded, in some instances up to 20-fold. (Wikipedia, 2014)\nPhthlates have been found to interfere with the production of male reproductive hormones in laboratory animals. These effects include lower testosterone level, decreased sperm count and lower sperm quality. Exposure to phthalates during gestation can also cause malformations of the male reproductive tract and testicular cancer. (Natural Resources Defense Council, undated)\nBecause phthalates are not chemically bound to products, they easily off-gas – especially with heat. Exposure to phthalates is by ingestion, inhalation, and applying products which contain them to the skin. (Natural Resources Defense Council, undated)\nWikipedia has a table listing 25 of the most common phthalates along with the abbreviations you might see on product ingredients lists.\nPhthalates are banned in cosmetics sold in the EU but not in the US. In this country, they are allowed in color cosmetics, scented lotions, body washes, hair care products, nail polishes and treatments. They may appear on the labels of these products as phthalate, DEP, DBP or simply as ‘fragrance’. (Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, 2011)\nOr they may not appear on the ingredients list at all. (Berl, 2012)\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \nCHEMICALS ALLOWED IN THE US – BANNED ELSEWHERE\nThe Environmental Working Group says our personal care products expose women to an average of 168 ingredients per day while men encounter about 85 a day.\nThis list compares US policy versus other countries for some of the more problematic ingredients (Brown, 2014) and (Plasticisers.orgn, 2013):\n \nPARABENS\n\n* Legal in the US.\n* Denmark first banned them in 2010 in products made for young   children.\n* The rest of the EU announced in 2012 that it was following suit.\n\n \nPHTHALATES\n* The US banned several types of phthlates in children’s toys in 2008 but continues  allowing them in cosmetics.\n* High phthalates will continue to be used in Europe. After February 2015, some others will be allowed in the EU only if they’ve been granted for a specific use while low phthalates will be phased out. \n \nFORMALDEHYDE  – used as a preservative in cosmetics\n* Legal in the US.\n\n* Canada bans its use in personal care products.\n \nPETROLEUM DISTALLATES – used as inexpensive emolients; can cause contact dermatitis or be contaminated with carcinogenic imporities\n* In the US they’re ingredients in eye shadow, lotions, creams, hairspray, foundation makeup and wart remover.\n* Banned in the EU.\n \nHYDROQUINONE – an effective skin lightener; linked to lung irritation and tumors in mice\n* Legal in the US.\n* Banned by Canada and some Asian and African countries.\n \nOCTINOXATE – a popular ingredient that works as a chemical sunscreen; an endocrine disruptor that can upset thyroid hormones and interfere with brain signals\n* Legal in the US.\n* Perhaps banned in Japan – I couldn’t track this down.\n\n \nMETHYL CELLOSOLVE – a solvent used in anti-aging creams, moisturizers and serums; a neurotoxin and irritant that may cause DNA mutations. Often lumped into ‘fragrance’ when included on labels\n* Reviled by the CDC but nevertheless legal in the US.\n* Banned in Canada.\n* Restricted in the EU.\n \nBUTYLATED HYDROXYANISOLE (BHA) – extends shelf life in lipsticks, moisturizers, shaving creams, fragrances and other personal care products; interferes with hormone function, is a possible human carcinogen, and adversely affects the environment by bio-accumulating in aquatic species\n* California requires a warning label on products containing it; legal elsewhere in the US.\n* The EU prohibits it in fragrances.\n \nQUATERNIUM-15 – a formaldehyde donor preservative used in body washes, cosmetic powders, shampoos, conditioners and eye shadows; an eye irritant, allergen and probable carcinogen\n* Legal in the US, Canada, China, Australia and Indonesia.\n \nNANOPARTICLES – particles so small they can get into the cells themselves and disrupt them; can lodge in airways when inhaled from cosmetic powders and aerosols or absorbed through the skin when in topical preparations.\n* The US doesn’t require products containing nanoparticles to be labeled.\n* Canada, the UK, and the US Organic Standards Board have or are going to ban nanoparticles in certified organics.\n \n \n\n \n \nREFERENCES\nAnderson, A.

That’s because many of these compounds seem to interact with estrogen receptors, and estrogen plays an important role in breast cancer.\nEndocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are found in tiny amounts in a wide range of products and can be ingested in your food and water, inhaled through the air, and even absorbed through the skin. In large doses, they have been shown to cause alterations in the reproductive organs and other sexual traits in animals. Humans are typically exposed to low doses but the exposure is fairly constant. So far, scientists have not been able to determine if EDCs play a role in breast cancer. A new study is under way to test urine samples taken from healthy women and breast-cancer patients for by-products of phthalates, a type of EDC. “We’re asking whether the levels are higher in the women who develop breast cancer,” says Katherine Reeves, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who is leading the study. The results will be released in 2018.\n PHOTO: STOCKSY\nAllure's all-time favorite skincare products:\n\n","Followers":"","title_name":"Are Endocrine Disruptors Really a Big Deal?","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Patrick Rogers","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"OCTOBER 18, 2015,","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.allure.com/beauty-trends/blogs/daily-beauty-reporter/2015/10/endocrine-disrupters-breast-cancer.html","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

Many conventional cosmetics are formulated for performance at the risk and detriment of your long term health. Most conventional cosmetics contain one or more ingredients that are classed as ‘endocrine disruptors’, which means that when slathered on your skin, hair, nails, lips and is absorbed, these ingredients do a confusing little dance with your hormones.\nHow do cosmetic endocrine disruptors confuse my natural hormone balance?\nThe specific chemical composition of certain cosmetic ingredients looks and reacts within your body as if it were estrogen. Your body can’t tell the difference between the cosmetic chemical ingredients and your own naturally produced hormones. Your body simply sees more estrogen floating around, provoking your body to shift your hormones and body processes to accommodate for this new influx of estrogen.\nAccording to the Environmental Working Group, “There is no end to the tricks that endocrine disruptors can play on our bodies: increasing production of certain hormones; decreasing production of others; imitating hormones; turning one hormone into another; interfering with hormone signaling; telling cells to die prematurely; competing with essential nutrients; binding to essential hormones; accumulating in organs that produce hormones.”\nWhy would endocrine disrupting ingredients be in my cosmetics knowing that they aren’t good for me?\nPerformance is queen for many beauty buyers who are unaware of the long-term side effects of extremely high-performance, long shelf life, and long-wear products that employ endocrine disrupting ingredients.\nEndocrine disrupting cosmetic ingredients, like Parabens and Phthalates, offer conventional cosmetic companies very low cost solutions that yield high impact results from a product performance and shelf life perspective. They make good business sense to use. There is mounting evidence, however, that what may be good for big-business profits is devastating in terms of our health and long-term well being.\n\nFragrance is made up of endocrine disrupting chemicals.\nHere are the three main endocrine disrupting cosmetic ingredients to completely avoid:\n1. Fragrance / Parfum: This ingredient is a ‘catch-all’ ingredient listing that could include 30+ ingredients. I personally avoid any product that contains this faux ingredient. Seeing ‘Fragrance’ on an ingredient label always smells fishy to me and clearly communicates the company’s lack of interest in being open, honest, and transparent about what the true composition of their formulas are. Often companies will claim that the ‘Fragrance’ is proprietary or a top-secret formula and this is why they simply list it as fragrance.\nIn 2010, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics commissioned laboratory tests on a number of the most famous fragrances. The tests revealed 38 secret chemicals in 17 name brand fragrance products not listed on the label. Among the secret ingredients were a number of ingredients associated with hormone disruption.\nPerhaps there is something super special about their scent. However, is that more important than your health? When it comes to your health, I don’t believe this is an adequate response to requests for transparency.\n2. Parabens: Parabens are the most commonly used broad-band cosmetic preservative. There are many variations of Parabens. None of them are necessary and a number of them have been identified to have estrogenic effects on the body. For simplicity sake, avoid any product containing any permutation of Parabens.\n3. Phthalates: Banned in many countries, Diethyl Phthalate [DEP] and Dimethyl Phthalate [DMP] are well known endocrine disruptors commonly used in nail polish to increase long-wear and chip-resistant nail flexibility. Many fragrances use Phthalates as well as an ingredient to prolong their scent.\nWe are at our most naturally beautiful self when we are balanced. The importance of hormone balance and regulation cannot be overstated. I know how I get when my hormones aren’t balanced. Avoiding endocrine disrupting ingredients is a great first step to a more balanced body.\nAt Afterglow, we avoid endocrine disrupting ingredients. We never formulate using Phthalates, Parabens, or Fragrance.\nDiscover our full line of natural cosmetics to keep your face and hormones happy!\nWritten by: Kristin Adams, Founder \u0026 CEO\n24222 ","Followers":"","title_name":"Top 3 Cosmetic Endocrine Disruptors","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Alexis Hawkins |","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"15-May-15","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"https://www.afterglowcosmetics.com/cosmetic-endocrine-disruptors/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

I’ve got a FULL Beauty Detox Plan (including what chemicals to avoid and what products to use and beauty recipes) in my NEW book Eating Clean: The 21-Day Plan to Detox, Fight Inflammation, and Reset Your Body).\nChemicals and toxins are not just in your food – they are also widely used in your favorite personal care products such as makeup, deodorant, mouthwash, toothpaste, shampoo and conditioner! I switched all of my personal care products when I became sick and I was told by my Integrative M.D.’s how these toxic ingredients were endocrine disruptors, leading to cancer, autoimmune diseases and other illnesses. I was amazed that EVERY product that I had contained toxic ingredients. Even my beautiful, expensive makeup that I thought was so ‘perfect’! I was shocked because I thought the high-quality products in fancy stores were made from quality ingredients- but I was fooled- by advertising.\nOur skin absorbs 60% of any topical product we use and more than 10,000 ingredients are allowed for use in our personal care items. Many of these ingredients are hazardous to our health but they are used in everything from makeup to facial moisturizer and nail polish remover! It’s amazing that the average woman wears nearly 515 chemicals a day and will eat nearly 4 pounds of lipstick in her lifetime, so make sure your lipstick does NOT contain lead or any chemicals.\nNow, don’t stress out. Just take yourself  to your nearest health food store or Whole Foods Market to find a toxin-free product. But, you must be careful because even though a product claims to be organic or natural or just because it’s being sold in a healthy store does NOT mean that it is truly toxin free. Some of the products sold in these stores still contain Parabens and Phthalates just like any conventional brand. This is such a shame but it’s why I’m here to help educate you about which ingredients are safe and which are not.\nClean Living \nI made some important lifestyle changes in order to stay healthy. I closely examined the everyday products I used and found that many harbored harmful metals and chemicals that can adversely impact overall health. Here are several beauty products that I “detoxified” from my life.\nMakeup and Personal Care Products\nChemicals like parabens are added to personal care products to keep bacteria and mold from growing in the packaging. These additives are considered endocrine disruptors, which can lead to hormone-related cancers in adults and early onset of puberty in girls. Parabens can be found in many household items, including cosmetics, lotions, soaps, toothpaste, shampoos, moisturizers, shaving gels, fragrances and soaps. Read labels carefully and choose products with a short list of all-natural ingredients.\nSheets and Towels\nCertain fabrics may be laced with toxic chemicals. I removed all the towels and sheets from my home and replaced them with items made with organic, all-natural fibers.\nShower Curtains\nVinyl shower curtains are made with polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which can release chemical fumes that linger in your home for months and can impact your health. I now use a water-resistant cotton shower liner made with organic fabric.\nHere is a list of the major toxins that are known to cause disease and have been proven to be toxic to our bodies:\n\nPCB’s (Highly toxic chemicals banned in the 1970’s but 24 million are unaccounted for. Currently, farm raised salmon contain PCB’s)\nDioxins (Used in chlorinated cleaners and may end up in animals with high fat content such as fish and shellfish)\nHeavy Metals (Mercury, lead, arsenic, aluminum and cadmium accumulate in the soft tissues of our bodies and are found in nasal sprays, shampoo and antiperspirant deodorant)\nAsbestos (Used to insulate older buildings- cancer causing material)\nParabens (Found in most personal care products, baby lotions and cosmetics.

I promised some of our customers that I would go over the information, but there is too much for one article. So here’s the first – hope you find it useful!Endocrine Disruptors seemed a good place to start, since they rated a mention in over half of the products on the list:Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (in 44 products);Cyclopentasiloxane and/or Cyclotetrasiloxane (in 32 products);Propylparaben and/or Butylparaben (in 26 products) ; andTriclosan (in 6 products).Hormones are incredibly important to every stage of our development, controlling and regulating our growth, metabolism, nervous system, reproduction, sleep and mood, among many other things. The glands that secrete hormones are known collectively as the Endocrine System. When we speak of endocrine disruptors, we’re speaking of chemicals that can interfere with the normal functioning of the endocrine system and hormone production.Research suggests that endocrine disruptors may pose the greatest risk during pregnancy and early postnatal development when organ and neural systems are forming – and this is why it’s important to limit exposure to endocrine disruptors if you are pregnant, breast feeding, or thinking about getting pregnant in the near future. It was in this context that we’ve already mentioned endocrine disruptors known as phthalates in earlier blog posts, here and here.It’s also really important for teenagers of course! To be honest, I would recommend avoiding endocrine disruptors at ANY time, but most especially during any phase when the body is going through significant growth or change related to hormones.As mentioned above, 32 of the 185 products listed were on the list because of containing the silicone emollients Cyclopentasiloxane and/or Cyclotetrasiloxane, both known hormone disruptors. Incidentally, Cyclopentasiloxane is one of the chemicals that are in the ‘Herbal Nappy Cream’ that we blogged about a while back. You find them in a lot of face creams, sunscreens, foundation and hair products, often in combination with other synthetic silicone oils (eg Cyclomethicone or Dimethicone).The presence of Ethylhexyl Methylcinnamate earned a place on the list for 44 products. This is a UV filter that has been shown to impact upon the endocrine systems of laboratory animals. The chemical has been identified in humans, including breast milk samples. Also known as Octinoxate, this is found in sunscreens, tinted moisturiser, foundations, lip balms and other products.It’s already a selling-point for a product to be Paraben-Free. In 2014, some of the most dangerous Parabens – Isobutyl, Isopropyl, Benzyl, Pentyl and Phenylparaben – were prohibited in the EU, so none of these Parabens were found in the list of products. However, despite being known endocrine disruptors, Propylparaben and Butylparaben are not yet banned and their presence saw another 26 products added to the list of Products to Avoid.Last but not least, the antibacterial Triclosan is responsible for a further 6 products being on the list. Triclosan used to be found in a lot of toothpaste, deodorant and mouthwash. It’s known to interfere with oestrogen and thyroid function, which is why most – though sadly not all – companies have eliminated it from their formulations.I know it seems reasonable for us to think that the Government would be right across this sort of thing and would ban chemicals that are known or suspected to be harmful. Unfortunately, in Australia we tend to follow the ‘lead’ of the US, which has banned less than 20 chemicals in skincare. This is in stark contrast to the EU which has banned well over 1200 chemicals. Therefore, here in Australia, for the time being at least, we need to keep doing our homework and getting smart about what to look out for. If you’re looking for a great place to start, there’s a whole lot of easy-to-understand information on Chemicals to Avoid on the Y natural website.Warmest wishes, Barbara xx","Followers":"","title_name":"French told to avoid 185 cosmetic products” – Part 1","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Barbara","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"28-Feb-16","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.ynatural.com.au/news/french-told-to-avoid-185-cosmetic-products-part-1/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

The EWG has changed some aspects of their Skin Deep Database which prompted the writing of this fresh look at why the EWG Skin Deep Database is a dubious resource.****\nIf you work in the cosmetic industry, then you should know about the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and their off-shoot group the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics. The EWG focuses on providing information while the CFSC attempts to get legislation passed. Ostensibly, they are consumer advocacy groups who endeavor to ensure that cosmetic manufacturers produce only safe products.\nA laudable goal and one that all cosmetic chemists can get behind.\nHowever, cosmetic chemists, formulators and the cosmetic industry already support this goal so the cosmetic products we produce are already safe. The EWG \u0026 CFSC are unnecessary.\nBut I’m certain that the good folks at these groups would disagree. From their perspective cosmetics are not safe. And cosmetic chemists can not be trusted to create safe formulas. They seem to believe that there are cosmetic chemists who want to create formulas that will poison their families and cause widespread cases of cancer. They don’t think very much of cosmetic chemists or formulators.\nProblems with these groups\nThe primary place that consumers (and beauty bloggers) find out about the EWG is through their online ingredient resource called the Skin Deep database. It’s an interesting concept and they’ve clearly put a lot of work into it. Unfortunately, it is full of misleading information \u0026 many things that are just wrong.\nSkin Deep database Flaws\nThere are a few obvious flaws in the database that have been pointed out to the EWG but they don’t seem interested in changing them. Here is what I mean.\nFalse information\nThere is false information in the database but they don’t seem interested in fixing it. For example, they have a listing for Polyparaben. They even give it a chemical rating and call it an endocrine disruptor. Unfortunately, there is no chemical called polyparaben. It doesn’t exist. How they managed to come up with a toxicity score and links to studies about a non-existent chemical is baffling and it certainly doesn’t build faith in the reliability of their data. If they had a cosmetic chemist review the information they were putting up before entering it into the database, perhaps this wouldn’t be a problem. Clearly, they don’t. And they don’t care to fix it because this has been pointed out to them directly.\nNonsense ratings\nCreating a hazard score is a dubious activity anyway (since it is the dose that makes the poison) but they aren’t even consistent within their own scoring system. For example, they have listings for both Sodium Coceth Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate. Cosmetic chemists know that these compounds are essentially identical with minimal differences. But somehow the Sodium Coceth Sulfate gets a 0 hazard score, while Sodium Laureth Sulfate gets a 4 hazard. This makes no sense.\nBelief not science\nPerhaps the worst thing about the EWG Skin Deep database is that they are unwilling to modify their conclusions when new evidence comes to light. They base their actions on a belief and use science only when it supports what they want to believe. Since they are a politically motivated group, they are unable to accept new science which might indicate an ingredient is more safe than previously thought. There is not a single instance of them changing their stance on any cosmetic ingredient.\nNo courage of their convictions\nBut the most galling thing about the EWG is that they are hypocrites who either don’t believe what they say or are more interested in making money off people than protecting them from “dangerous” products. For example, they list a Hall of Shame for sunscreens. In it they list specific products that are typical of “…what’s wrong with the sun protection business.” Of course, this does not stop them from making money through their Amazon Affiliate program by selling those same products. For example, they list Aveeno Baby Protection Sunblock as a Hall of Shame sunscreen because it is dangerous for babies but they’ll happily take your money if you want to buy the product.\nThis means they either do not care that they are making money off of products that they believe are dangerous…or…they don’t believe the products are really dangerous.\nEither way, it’s shifty.\nEWG and cosmetic chemists\nIf the EWG \u0026 the CFSC is to be believed, cosmetic chemists are evil people who do not care about the safety of the formulas they create. I think this is BS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Plus\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedin\n\n\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS:Cosmetic Industrycosmetic safetyewg \n\n130\n\n\n\n","Followers":"","title_name":"3 reasons the EWG is dubious resource","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Perry Romanowski","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":2012,"Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://chemistscorner.com/3-reasons-the-ewg-is-dubious-resource/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"","Linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/perryromanowski","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":"f-4, o-7"}

There’s an estimated 8 -12 million metric tons of plastic making its way into the oceans each year. And as the plastic mess in the oceans grows, so do concerns over the health of the marine creatures living in it.\nWhile it’s known that plastic bags and bottles pose a risk to sea creatures, a lesser-known threat is now coming to light, one that’s created when ocean waves and wind pulverize the plastic bags, bottles and other trash that ends up in the seas: “microplastics.”\nThese tiny plastic pieces are about the same size and shape as the algae eaten by some marine animals. How microplastics affect marine animals is not well understood.\nMicroplastic poses a growing concern in oceans and other aquatic habitats. (Image by 5Gyres, courtesy of Oregon State University)\nBut in recent years scientists have found that crustaceans that consume microplastics have a hard time reproducing. Going off a hunch that microplastics may affect the fertility of other filter feeders, researchers at the French Institute for the Exploitation of the Sea started feeding oysters microplastics.\nThe researchers observed two groups of oysters: one fed a normal diet of algae and another fed a mix of algae and microplastics. The oysters fed the mixed diet swiftly sucked up the microplastics as easily as they did algae. After two months the researchers have found microplastics take a toll on both oyster digestion and reproduction.\nOysters that consume microplastics eat more algae and absorb it more efficiently, says Arnaud Huvet, marine physiologist at the French research center and lead author of the study. This is because oysters expend extra energy to pass plastic through their digestive systems, increasing the rate at which they digest algae.\nWhile the digestion of microplastics diverts some energy away from reproduction, oysters’ ability to reproduce is almost halved: Female oysters produce fewer and smaller eggs while male oysters produce slower-swimming sperm. Offspring produce more slowly. The cause? Blame the chemicals that make up microplastics.\nDuring digestion microplastics appear to leach hormone-disrupting chemicals into oysters’ bodies, says Huvet. These chemicals, also called “endocrine disruptors,” are known to lead to diminished fertility and an increased cancer rate in laboratory animals, wildlife and humans. They’re found in all kinds of everyday products, including cosmetics, pesticides and plastics.\nCan the microplastics accumulating in oysters’ bodies harm the animals or humans that eat them? Right now, Huvet says, that’s unclear. But he points out his study adds to a slowly growing body of evidence highlighting the health impacts of plastic pollution in the oceans.\nSafina Center Sustainable Seafood Program Director Elizabeth Brown-Hornstein agrees: “This study provides further evidence that plastic litter has far-reaching effects on the oceans and that there is an urgent need to take meaningful action to tackle this issue.”\nLearn more about plastic and other marine pollution, and what you can do to help, here.\n","Followers":11,"title_name":"More Plastic, Fewer Oysters?","ShareThis":"","comments":[{"date":"March 1, 2:59 am","text":"Dear Mr. Safina,In light of the growing apprehension regarding ocean pollution, this is a fantastic piece that sets up a strong foundation for addressing the damages caused by microplastics. Currently in my final year of study as an undergraduate biology student, I am shocked and intrigued by the massive amount of plastic reportedly circulating the oceans. However, considering the broad range of products from which this pollution originates, it is no shock to me that tiny plastic particles can accumulate to such quantities as 93-236 thousand tons floating in the oceans as predicted by a recent study in Environmental Research Letters. It concerns me that this amount is 37 times greater than previous estimates because it speaks to just how much more abundant these pesky products are, and how much of an impact they can realistically have on marine wildlife. You address the harm that consumption of microplastics has had on crustaceans and other filter feeders, and it seems that adding microplastics to the diet of oysters proves that this can have repercussions on a number of marine organisms. As reiterated from the study by the French Institute for the Exploitation of the Sea, “Oysters that consume microplastics eat more algae and absorb it more efficiently…[their] ability to reproduce is almost halved.” This information you present is valid and credible, but should there be further emphasis in the post regarding the seriousness of these health implications? Filter feeding organisms are vital components of marine food webs, and their demise could mean severe threats to numerous trophic levels, and in turn to the humans who rely on these species as a source of food.This past December, President Obama signed a bill banning the use of microbeads in all personal care products. This act is an indication that microplastic pollution is a genuine concern to the highest levels of government and will continue to damage aquatic habitats and waterways if preventative action is not taken immediately. Your article additionally mentions that the chemicals comprising microplastics are to blame for reproductive complications in oysters, which is a very important point to address. Chemical toxins such as DDT and BPA have been found to adhere to microplastic particles according to a Global Microplastics Initiative, which then “enter the food chain when ingested by aquatic life, accumulating in birds, fish, marine mammals and potentially humans.” Could there be further implications of such chemicals to the well being of this broad range of organisms? How else might the toxins and accumulation of microplastics affect marine species? Since microplastics have already been found inside the bodies of so many organisms, it would be beneficial to address some of the effects they can have on these various other animals as well, so that readers outside the scientific community can have a better understanding of the issue as a whole. That being said, your article is extremely informative and acknowledges the use and waste of plastic products as a matter of high priority. I am interested to hear your thoughts and opinions as attempts to mitigate the problem continue to develop.","author_name":"Jessica Perelman"},{"date":"March 9, 5:23 pm","text":"Thank you, Carl, for your work.We just don’t listen, to our planet, to our experts, to our consciences.

They can also be found as additives or contaminants in food.\nChristophe Rousselle, representing the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health \u0026 Safety, said at a panel discussion in Brussels on 25 June, organised by the European Consumers' Organisation (BEUC), that at the moment it is difficult for public agencies and risk assessors to know in which products chemical compounds are used and the concentration.\nRisk assessors need this information in order to have a sound, risk-based approach. He added that this makes it even more difficult to predict 'cocktail-effects'.\n\"It's important to take combined exposure and effects into account, especially with endocrine disruptors. There's a lot of knowledge that's still missing. It's important to be able to identify the synergies between endocrine disruptors,\" Rousselle said.\nSilvia Maurer, safety and environment senior policy officer at BEUC, argued that was the reason for insisting on the precautionary principle to be kept in as a guiding point in EU legislation on product safety.\nToo slow\nSome health campaigners have called for a ban on more than 800 chemical substances to fulfil a precautionary principle for the benefit of consumers.\nPavel Poc, Czech MEP from the Socialists and Democrats (S\u0026D) group, said that even though the idea is good, it would be impossible to carry out. Instead, he urged health campaigners to invite consumers to the debates as their support is needed.\n\"If we don't have more stakeholder meetings with the public, we won't reach anything. Regarding the Commission … Everything is going too slow,\" Poc said.\nBertil Heerink, director-general of Cosmetics Europe, said his sector is one of the few strong ones in Europe, bigger than in the US and Japan combined.\nThe sector's ambition is to keep it that way, but this can only be done through consumer trust which the industry will keep through a more science-based approach to ensure consumer safety.\n\"For us, science is the engine for innovation and we have a very innovative sector and that is also the reason why we are still so successful.\"\n\n\n\nBackground\nHuman health depends on a well-functioning endocrine system to regulate the release of certain hormones that are essential for functions such as metabolism, growth and development, sleep and mood.\nSome substances known as endocrine disruptors can alter the function(s) of this hormonal system increasing the risk of adverse health effects.\nSome endocrine disrupting chemicals occur naturally, while synthetic varieties can be found in pesticide, electronics, personal care products and cosmetics.

EDCs are linked to human reproductive abnormalities, immune disorders, cancer and obesity and obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes. Babies, children and adolescents – humans in a stage of quick development and growth – are considered to be most at risk from EDCs, as early exposure to EDCs may lead to illness in adulthood.[1]\nBisphenol A (BPA) is an EDC and is one of the most common and widely manufactured chemicals in the world. It has “feminizing” or “oestrogen-mimicking” properties on the human and can be harmful to reproduction even at low levels of exposure.BPA is linked to a wide variety of health problems, such as birth defects, obesity, cancers and fertility problems, as well as early puberty in girls. BPA can be found in many common goods such as plastics, food and drink containers, toys and computers.[2] BPA-based plastics are clear, sturdy and cheap to manufacture and easy to use – and therefore attractive for business.[3] Most food cans are lined with plastic containing BPA that can leach into the food. In thermal paper, such as in cash receipts, BPA is a powdery substance on the surface and can easily be absorbed by the skin.[4] A large study by French scientists have shown how BPA is easily absorbed through the skin from thermal paper[5] and it advised expecting mothers to avoid handling thermal paper and cashiers to wash their hands regularly during the working day.[6]\nParabens are also EDCs used mainly in personal care products and in cosmetics.  They are used as preservatives in cosmetics because of their antimicrobial properties. Exposure to parabens is linked to various birth defects, infertility and cancer. [7]\nPhthalates are another group of EDCs that are used as softeners for plastics in flooring, toys, clothes, paints and furniture just to name a few. Phthalates are not chemically bound to plastics and can easily migrate into air, water, dust and humans, with negative effects on reproduction and metabolism.[8]\nWe are completely surrounded by these substances and over 90% of the US population[9] test positive for BPA.[10]The potential cost to society in terms of future negative health effects is therefore significant, with the potential negative health effects manifesting themselves only years after exposure, adding to the challenges of EDC research and analysis. The World Health Organisation (WHO) warned in a 2012 report that endocrine disruptors constitute a global threat.[11] An EU funded report from June 2014 estimates that EDCs contribute to or were responsible of at least 2-5% of the illnesses that have been attributed to EDC exposure.[12] This means EDCs would be directly responsible for c. $41bn in health costs and lost productivity every year in the European Union, with diabetes and autism being by far the largest cost burdens.[13] However, policy makers have been remarkably slow in reacting to this threat, focusing on analysing huge amounts of research in this space, instead of taking a precautionary stance – which should be expected when serious negative human health issues are at stake.\nOne of the reasons for the slow progress – and the source of much of the scientific controversy – is the “low dose effect” of EDCs. For many hazardous chemicals, there are regulations in place stating the maximum levels of exposure that can be tolerated without serious damage to human health. This regulatory approach has been questioned for EDCs, as tests on pregnant animals have shown that e.g. BPA produces developmental problems and adulthood illnesses even at doses well below the government’s safety cut-off levels, the “low dose effect”. EDCs seem to behave differently from most other toxic substances, perhaps because our bodies’ respond so easily to natural hormones, such as oestrogens. The US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is one organisation working to bridge the gap between the regulatory studies and research into low dose effects. The NIEHS is currently funding work carried out in the way regulatory studies are normally conducted but covering a much broader dose range than is traditionally looked at in regulatory studies. Some scientists believe – and hope – that the legacy of BPA might be that low dose effects will be considered for all chemicals and not just for BPA and EDCs in future regulatory safety processes.[14]\nRegulatory progress has taken place, however, with Canada, Europe, Australia and several states in the US banning BPA in infant feeding bottles in the last few years. France banned all BPA-products affecting pregnant women and children under the age of three in 2013 and has set an expanded ban on any BPA that comes into contact with food from 2015.[15] While regulatory progress is slow, the direction of travel seems clear – regulation on endocrine disruptors is likely to be tightened over time. The EU is legally obliged to set uniform safety classifications and criteria on EDCs. This is likely to be finalised sometime in 2015.  A decision is crucial, as the EU with its REACH-regulations[16] has been the leading global authority in regulating toxic substances. Many Asian countries have been fully or partly following the developments of EU REACH-regulations in their national chemical regulations.[17]\nThe US Food and Drug Administration, on the other hand, has been a laggard to date. The challenges and risks in the process for EDC regulatory classification in the EU are two-fold; firstly, there is fierce resistance by the large chemical and pesticide producers such as Bayer, BASF and Monsanto and secondly, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) being negotiated between the EU and the US and aiming to remove trade barriers between these two, by harmonising technical regulations, standards and approval procedures.[18] These two aspects could threaten the EU’s traditional precautionary approach to health and environmental issues.[19]\nWhile regulators are dragging their feet, consumers increasingly want to know what is in their daily products and food —and are demanding healthier and cleaner alternatives. The continued strong growth of organic food can be viewed as evidence for this trend. US organic food production has increased by about 240% between 2002 and 2011, compared with 3% growth in the non-organic food market.  The US organic food market is expected to continue growing at roughly 14% per year to 2018, much faster than the overall food market.[20] For individual companies this growth can be even more dramatic. For example, food maker General Mills, which announced plans this month to purchase organic food brand Annie’s Homegrown for $820 million, reported that its organic and healthy food lines grew by 35% in 2013compared to 2% growth for its non-organic lines.[21] Some companies have been first movers in responding to these healthier opportunities and have successfully developed substitutes to EDC substances or are diversifying their product offerings away from EDCs.\nFor instance, the chemical giant Eastman Chemical has developed a business strategy that aims to capitalize on the demand for non-toxic chemicals. Eastman has increased its production of non-phthalate plasticizers, such as Benzoflex, Eastman TXIB, as well as Eastman 168, which is used as an alternative to DEHP-based products, a substance on the EU REACH Authorization List[22]. The company states that it has 10 non-phthalate plasticizer facilities and has further increased production by 60% following a retrofit. The company said it planned to increase production capacity of Eastman 168 non-phthalate plasticizer by an additional 15% by mid-2014. In 2013, the volume of Eastman 168 plasticizer sales grew by 25% or three times faster than its traditional plasticizer sales, indicative of strong growth of this market segment.[23]\nAnother interesting example is Eden Foods, another US organic food concern, which became alarmed by the toxicity of BPA in cans and food packaging long before the issue made it to mainstream news. In 1999, it asked its packaging supplier, Ball Corp, to develop a BPA-free can. The cost was 14% higher for the BPA-free cans in 1999; as of 2012 it is 30% more expensive than BPA-containing cans. Even so, Eden Foods has always been able to pass on the more expensive packaging costs to consumers, without suffering decreases in demand, again pointing to the strong underlying demand for healthier alternatives.[24]\nEven in non-consumer-facing sectors there are companies moving away from EDCs. For example, the Finnish water treatment company, Kemira, decided to phase-out all EDC substances from their water treatment substance portfolios, in anticipation of tightening regulation regarding EDCs.[25]\nThere is a strong sense of déjà vu in this debate. As with actions to mitigate climate change, or reduce air pollution in our cities or demands for properly labelling GMOs in our foods, it seems that consumers would want to have much more information and transparency, but also strong policy action in order to achieve healthier and more sustainable lives.  However – largely due to industry standing in the way – policy action is often painfully slow. This same dynamic applies to the slow pace in progress for regulating endocrine disruptor substances. It is therefore this disconnect in demand and supply of sustainable action that creates a great opportunity for forward-looking businesses who can see past the entanglements to greener fields ahead.\nThe author would like to thank Sweden-based NGO ChemSec for providing outstanding information around EDCs and chemical safety more generally.

Perry, MD, FACS \nDr. Perry is a board certified plastic surgeon, an Adjunct Associate Professor at Columbia University, and a member of the Medical Advisory Board for The Dr. Oz Show.\nUV light\r\ncauses skin cancer and prematurely ages the skin, and so it’s very important to\r\nprotect our skin with sunscreen. We don’t want to block sunshine completely –\r\nabout 20 minutes each day is good for us – it boosts our vitamin D and improves\r\nour mood. Beyond 20 minutes, however, and our immune system suffers. We either need to spend\r\nthe rest of the day inside or protect our skin with sunscreen.\n\n\nThere are\r\n17 individual sunscreen ingredients that are FDA approved: 15 of these are\r\nclear chemicals that absorb UV light and two are made of minerals that reflect\r\nUV light. Of these 15, nine are known endocrine disruptors. To be effective,\r\nchemical sunscreens need to be rubbed into their skin 20 minutes before sun\r\nexposure. They do a pretty good job at blocking UV light, but they actually get\r\nused up as the sun shines on them. In fact, some sunscreens lose as much as 90%\r\nof their effectiveness in just an hour, so they need to be reapplied often.\r\nThis is not the case with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the two mineral, or\r\nphysical, sunscreens. These two work very differently – they sit on the surface\r\nof the skin and physically block UV light.\n\n\nChemical\r\nsunscreens don’t sit on the surface of the skin – they soak into it and quickly\r\nfind their way into the bloodstream. They scatter all over the body without\r\nbeing detoxified by the liver and can be detected in blood, urine, and breast\r\nmilk for up to two days after a single application. That would be just fine if\r\nthey were uniformly safe – but they’re not.\n\n\nAs I\r\nmentioned, nine of the 15 chemical sunscreens are considered endocrine\r\ndisruptors. Those are chemicals that interfere with the normal function of\r\nhormones. The hormones most commonly disturbed are estrogen, progesterone,\r\ntestosterone, and thyroid. Endocrine disruptors, like\r\nsome ingredients in chemical sunscreens, can cause abnormal development of\r\nfetuses and growing children. They cause early puberty and premature breast\r\ndevelopment in girls, and small and undescended testicles in boys. They cause\r\nlow sperm counts and infertility. Endocrine disruptors that act like estrogen\r\ncan contribute to the development of breast and ovarian cancers in women, and\r\nother endocrine disruptors may increase the chance of prostate cancer in men.\n\n\nSounds\r\npretty unsettling, doesn’t it? But there’s more. As I said earlier, chemical\r\nsunscreens function by absorbing UV light. In the process, some may get used up\r\nand mutate. Some generate DNA-damaging chemicals called “free radicals.” These\r\nmay lead to cancers.\n\n\nI’m\r\npretty negative about chemical sunscreens, and while I do have to tell you that\r\nI believe they are not proven to cause cancer, as I said on The Dr. Oz Show,\r\n“Where there’s smoke, there’s fire.”\n\n\n \n\n\nPoisoning\r\nthat takes place over decades is difficult to study. Chemicals like arsenic and\r\nbotulism make us sick very quickly, and so it was easy to figure out that they\r\nare toxins. Lead is a toxin that takes longer to cause illness, so it was many\r\nyears before the government listened to scientists and restricted its use. And\r\nchemical sunscreens are even harder to study since their effects are subtle and\r\ntake a long time to appear.\n\n\nAs you\r\nread this, you might be saying, “Why is this guy – a plastic surgeon – saying\r\nsomething I’ve never heard about before?” This information isn’t new for me. My\r\npatients know I’ve been talking about sunscreen and other cosmetic toxicity for\r\nabout 15 years. But I’m just an interpreter of science. And experts agree with\r\nme.\n\n\nR. Thomas\r\nZoeller, MS, PhD, is a Professor of Biology at the University of Massachusetts.\r\nHe’s an author of the Endocrine Society’s scientific statement about endocrine\r\ndisrupting chemicals and their official representative. He said, “Dr. Perry\r\nmakes an important point that sunscreens are applied to skin in a formulation\r\nthat serves as a drug delivery system and that some sunscreens are known to\r\ninterfere with hormone action. The way in which these chemicals can interact\r\nwith hormone systems could plausibly increase the risk of various cancers as\r\nwell as other endocrine disorders.”\n\n\nIf there\r\nwere no good alternatives, we’d be in a pickle – we’d have to make some hard\r\ndecisions whether or not to use sunscreen. But, fortunately, we have great\r\nalternatives.\n\n\nZinc\r\noxide and titanium dioxide are rocks that are ground down to a fine\r\nconsistency. They do a great job at blocking both UVA and UVB light. Zinc is\r\nless whitening on the skin and blocks nearly all dangerous UV light.\r\nInexpensive versions of these sunscreens are gooey and while you might put them\r\non your kid’s skin, most people don’t like them. But newer zinc oxide\r\nsunscreens contain particles so small that they are transparent. These\r\nsunscreens are called micronized and do a great job at protecting against UV\r\nradiation. Even newer sunscreens use rocks that are ground into smaller bits\r\ncalled nanoparticles. Nanoparticles have their own issues, and some people\r\ndon’t consider them to be uniformly safe.\n\nBottom line? Use a micronized zinc oxide\r\ncontaining SPF 15 broad-spectrum sunscreen every day of the year and an SPF 30\r\nwhen you’re on the beach or working in the garden. How much should you use? An\r\nounce spread over your whole body should do it. And reapply it every 2 hours or\r\nso. \n\n\n\nBy Arthur W. Perry,\r\nMD, FACS \n\r\nDr. Perry is a board certified plastic surgeon, an Adjunct Associate Professor\r\nat Columbia University, and a member of the Medical Advisory Board for The Dr. Oz Show.\n\n\n\n \nThe Dirty Dozen\nPosted on June 22, 2012\nThe David Suzuki Foundation May 4 2010\n From shampoos, to soaps, to lotions, to makeup — it’s not uncommon for a single person to use 10 or more personal care products each day. But some of the ingredients in beauty products aren’t that pretty. U.S. researchers found that one in eight of the 82,000 ingredients used in personal care products are industrial chemicals, including carcinogens, pesticides, reproductive toxins, endocrine disruptors, plasticizers, degreasers, and surfactants. \nHere is a list of 12 chemicals you might want to avoid:\n 1. BHA or BHT – used mainly in moisturizers and makeup as antioxidants and preservatives. BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) BHA is toxic to the immune system and a possible human carcinogen. BHT may be toxic to the skin, lungs, liver, and immune system. Both chemicals can cause allergic reactions, are suspected of interfering with hormone function (endocrine disruption), and may promote tumour growth.\n 2. Coal Tar Dyes – used in hair dyes (Look for p-phenylenediamine or colours identified as “C.I.” followed by a 5-digit number) Phenylenediamine, has been found to be carcinogenic. Coal tar itself is recognized as a human carcinogen and the main concern with coal tar.\n 3. DEA – used to make cosmetics creamy or sudsy (Look also for related chemicals MEA and TEA) DEA (diethanolamine) and DEA compounds irritate the skin and eyes and may be toxic to the immune and nervous systems. DEA compounds can also react with other ingredients in cosmetics to form carcinogenic nitrosamines.\n 4. Dibutyl Phthalate – used mainly in nail products and are also unlisted fragrance ingredients. It can enhance the capacity of other chemicals to cause genetic mutations, although it is not a mutagen itself. In laboratory experiments, it has been shown to interfere with hormone function (endocrine disruption) causing reproductive and developmental problems.\n 5. Formaldehyde-releasing Preservatives – used as preservatives in cosmetics (Look for DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, methenamine, quarternium-15, and sodium hydroxymethylglycinate) Formaldehyde is a recognized human carcinogen. They are also toxic to aquatic organisms.\n 6. Fragrance or Parfum Fragrance recipes are considered a trade secret, so companies are not required to disclose fragrance chemicals in the list of ingredients. Many of these hidden ingredients are irritants and can trigger allergic attacks, migraines, and chemical-induced nerve irritation in sensitive individuals. Individual fragrance ingredients have been associated with cancer and neurotoxicity.\n 7. Parabens – are widely used in cosmetics as a preservative (Look for ingredients ending in “paraben” (e.g., methylparaben)) Suspected of interfering with hormone function (endocrine disruption).\n 8. PEG compounds – are widely used in cream bases in cosmetics (Look also for related chemical propylene glycol and other ingredients with the letters “eth” (e.g., polyethylene glycol)). May harm the nervous system and interfere with human development.\n 9. Petrolatum – used as a barrier to lock moisture in the skin in a variety of moisturizers A petrochemical, it can be contaminated with cancer-causing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\n 10. Siloxanes – used in cosmetics to soften, smooth, and moisten (Look for cyclomethicone and ingredients ending in “siloxane” (e.g., cyclotetrasiloxane) They are also suspected of interfering with hormone function (endocrine disruption) and of liver toxicity.\n 11. Sodium Laureth Sulfate – used in cosmetics as a cleansing agent and also to make products bubble and foam (Look also for related chemical sodium lauryl sulfate and other ingredients with the letters “eth” (e.g., sodium laureth sulfate). Contaminants may cause cancer.\n 12. Triclosan – used mainly in antiperspirants/deodorants, cleansers, and hand sanitizers as a preservative and an anti-bacterial agent Is suspected of interfering with hormone function (endocrine disruption).\n To enjoy the full article and to have access to some of the research, visit the David Suzuki website at: \n \nhttp://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/health/science/toxics/dirty-dozen-cosmetic-chemicals/ \n \n","Followers":"","title_name":"YOUR SUNSCREEN MIGHT BE POISONING YOU","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Arthur W Perry","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"16/05/2013","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"Dr. Perry is a board certified plastic surgeon, an Adjunct Associate Professor at Columbia University, and a member of the Medical Advisory Board forThe Dr. Oz Show.","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.vidomanaturals.com/blogs/cosmetic-ingredients-to-avoid","type":"blog","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/drarthurperrymd","Share":"","Linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-w-perry-md-facs-20b01a10","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

Hormones are released into the blood by various glands including the thyroid, ovaries and testicles.\nThe hormone system is connected to the nervous and immune systems. The most miniscule levels of hormones can have great effect and so exposures to very low levels of EDCs can play havoc with nature, particularly at crucial stages of development and during the complex developmental stages before birth. Many of the initial reports about the effects of EDCs come from wildlife. Examples are egg-shell thinning in birds, feminisation in fish, malformations of the genitalia in reptiles, and reproductive and immune problems in various mammals.\nToday, in humans, EDCs are linked to infertility and reproductive problems, obesity \u0026 diabetes, heart disease, and hormone related cancers, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer and testicular cancer.  Another concern is the potential for effects on brain function and cognitive development as thyroid hormones play a crucial role in orchestrating the development of the brain.\nWe now know that EDCs include certain pesticides, as well as some industrial chemicals used in a variety of consumer products. Humans are exposed to EDCs via consumer products such as flame retardants in soft furnishings and electrical products, plastics in the lining of food cans, PVC flooring and many cosmetics. We are exposed to several EDCs at any one time and there is now research that indicates that these exposures can ‘add up’ leading to combined exposure effects.\nFor more details and references, see the answers to questions on the chemicals involved, why is there concern, what’s so special about EDCs and the cocktail effect.\nThis page is part of CHEM Trust’s Hormone Disrupting Chemicals FAQ – Full list of questions here.\nThe next question is “Is hormone disruption a new issue?“.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInPocketEmailGoogle ","Followers":"","title_name":"What are hormone disrupting chemicals (or endocrine disrupting chemicals, EDCs)?","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":37,"Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.chemtrust.org.uk/what-are-hormone-disrupting-chemicals-or-endocrine-disrupting-chemicals-edcs/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

The earliest records of makeup usage date back at least 6000 years, and in the 1600s women used star- and moon-shaped patches to cover smallpox scars. And just as long there have been people telling others such practices are immoral or dangerous.\nIf you have been scouring the net for natural acne treatment information, no doubt you’ve read articles exposing the dangers of cosmetics. Makeup is said to clog your pores, prevent your skin from breathing, and make your acne worse. Oh, and let’s not forget that it causes cancer.\nOf course the natural health proponents have yet to find a non-natural substance they don’t find horribly dangerous. So just because some people claim makeup is dangerous and causes acne doesn’t make it so.\n\n\nNaturally Clear Skin Without The Confusion And Stress\nZen of Clear Skin shows how to liberate\r\nyourself from acne - and the stress of trying\r\nto get over it.\n\nFREE \r\nDownload \n\n\n\n\n\n\nZen of Clear Skin\n\n\n\nI get a lot of emails from people regarding makeup, and in this post I’ll do my best to address them. We’ll cover the following:\n\nPros of makeup, or why you should consider using makeup.\nDoes makeup cause acne?\nDo you need to worry about comedogenic ingredients in cosmetics?\nThe ‘dark side of beauty’ arguments, i.e. can cosmetic ingredients disrupt hormones and cause cancer? And should you be worried about them.\n\nI’ll do my best to address these questions with available science. But keep in mind this comes from I’m-a-guy-and-have-never-ever-touched-makeup perspective. So hold the desire to crucify me if and when you see me making silly makeup statements.\nWhy you should consider using makeup\nThis one should be obvious. Because using makeup to hide blemishes improves your self-esteem and makes you feel better about yourself. Like it or not, as a society we value beauty and aesthetics. In a recent podcast episode the Freakonomic guys went over some advantages good looking people have over not so good looking ones.\n\n\nMakeup is the easiest way to patch up self-esteem and reduce acne-causing stress.\n\nShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Google+\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are studies that quantify the improvements in self-esteem and quality of life in women with skin problems who start using makeup. But I think there’s such a thing as stating the obvious, so I’m not going to go over them here. Suffice to say that covering your blemishes with makeup is the fastest and most reliable way to feel better about yourself when you are out and about.\nI believe that makeup is not only good for self-esteem but also for your skin. By now it’s well established that stress can aggravate acne. And when it comes to increasing stress and anxiety, there’s nothing quite like having to go out with freshly popped blemishes on your face, especially of the cystic nature.\nThis puts you in the middle of a vicious cycle; acne causes stress that causes more acne. And the more you try to get over acne, the more frustrated you get, and the less effective your efforts become.\nSomething has to give for you to break out of this. Your options: 1) wait for acne to go away (can take a few decades), or 2) do something about stress. Since waiting for a few decades is not the preferred option for most people, it has to be stress. For most people covering pimples with makeup is the easiest and fastest way to reduce acne stress. And yes, you are faking it, but get over it; it’s good for your skin.\nBut makeup causes acne, right?\nDermatologists often tell patients they shouldn’t use makeup as it can aggravate skin problems. This seems to be one of those things dermatologists throw out that’s not based on any real science – much like the claim that diet does not affect acne. We’ll get to the comedogenicity concept soon, but let me first go over a few studies where scientists have studied the effect of makeup on skin conditions.\nMuch to my surprise, I could only find a handful of studies that touched on the topic.\nIn 2005 Dr.Hayashi and his Japanese colleagues asked a makeup artist to teach basic makeup techniques for 18 women with acne. The women applied makeup for 4 weeks while their acne was treated.\nAt the end of the study the women felt better about themselves, improved their social life, and their acne was better.\nWould their acne have gotten even better without makeup? Did the makeup interfere with the acne treatment? There’s no way to know since this study didn’t include a group without makeup. Looking at the results, acne dropped by about 40%, so I don’t think applying makeup had any negative effects on acne.\nI found 3 other studies that in some way looked at the effect of makeup on skin problems. None of the studies showed any indication that makeup, when properly selected and used, would aggravate acne.\nMakeup selection and usage – according to scientists\nFar be it from me to claim that nerdy scientists in white lab coats are your best source of beauty tips and makeup advice. However, the Japanese paper did make good points regarding selection and usage of makeup:\n\nThey used makeup designed for acne-prone skin, meaning it was non-comedogenic and non-irritating – according to the manufacturer.\nDon’t cover your entire face with several layers of concealer. Instead, use complementary color to blend in the blemishes. For example, apply green foundation over red pimples and you should get something resembling brownish tone. Then apply light layer of concealer.\nUse makeup to highlight and create focal points around eyes, lips or cheeks to draw the eye away from the blemishes.\n\nNote that I have zero experience with makeup and won’t take any responsibility for the above instructions. Use at your own peril 🙂\nDo anti-acne cosmetics work?\nSome cosmetics claim not only to be safe for acne-prone skin but to also treat acne. Is there any truth to these claims?\nIn principle, yes. I don’t see any reason why you couldn’t use cosmetics as a vehicle for delivering anti-acne ingredients to the skin. That said, I’m not a cosmetic chemist and can’t say if there’s something in makeup that prevents their use as delivery vehicles. It seems at least Neutrogena and CLINIQUE have makeup with salicylic acid, so it’s possible at least in some form.\nAlso, in 2013 Korean researchers published a study showing cosmetics containing bee venom can treat acne.\nSo in principle you can use makeup as an acne treatment. However, the real question is whether it’s better to use a dedicated acne treatment and then apply normal acne-safe makeup on top of it. I would assume that with dedicated acne treatment products you have a much wider choice of active ingredients.\nPresence of comedogenic ingredients does NOT mean the product causes acne\nFor over 50 years now scientists have applied chemicals to rabbit ears in order to find out if the said chemicals cause acne. In medical terms this is called comedogenicity testing.\nSome websites collect the results from such studies into long tables where cosmetic ingredients are rated by their comedogenicity.\nThey encourage you to be an acne detective by running around the store with that 3-foot long list and checking every product against it. If the product has an ingredient found in the list = acne, if it doesn’t = safe to use. So simple. So black and white. So utterly wrong.\n\n\nJapanese researchers show that products with known comedogenic ingredients don’t cause acne.\n\nShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Google+\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005 Dr. Zoe Diana Draelos and colleagues published a paper titled A re-evaluation of the comedogenicity concept. In the study they tested whether products that contain comedogenic ingredients actually cause acne. They took 6 people prone to back acne and applied products containing known comedogenic ingredients to the upper back of the participants. In total they tested 10 different products. The products were applied 3 times a week and left to stay until the next application. This went on for 4 weeks. The results were compared to both positive and negative controls. Positive control being a substance known to cause acne and negative control one known not to cause acne.\nIn all instances there was no difference between the negative control and any of the products. In comparison, the positive control caused 3 to 5 times more pimples than any of the products. In other words, a product with known comedogenic ingredients did not cause anymore acne than a noncomedogenic ingredient alone.\nThey also made some interesting points on the discussion section of the paper:\n\nComedogenicity tests often use very high doses of the tested substance. Whereas finished products often contain only small amounts of the substance. Think of it this way. Claiming that any product that contains comedogenic ingredients causes acne is like saying any food that contains salt will kill you because salt is lethal in high doses. Comedogenicity, like everything else, is a matter of dosage.\nThere are different ways to measure comedogenicity. Some tests label substances that irritate the skin but don’t trigger acne as comedogenic. Also, substances that dilate the skin pores, like salicylic acid, can be labeled as comedogenic. Yet, salicylic acid is used as a treatment for acne.\nHuman tests for comedogenicity often use exaggerated conditions. The substances are usually applied under occlusion (meaning the area is covered) and left on for several weeks, all of which increase the effect those substances have.\n\nThis study shows that simplistic acne detective work, where you run around the story with a 3-foot long list of dangerous ingredients, is a fool’s errand. My guess is that well over 90% of the supposedly dangerous products identified this way won’t actually cause acne.\nThis view was echoed in another paper that reviewed various acne models; experimental conditions that estimate what happens in human skin, like the rabbit ear model we talked earlier. Talking about the rabbit ear model, the paper states this model is unable to accurately depict the acnegenic potential of chemical compounds, and is therefore only valuable for distinguishing absolute negatives. In plain English, what happens in a rabbit ear is not the same as what happens in human skin, and we can only use this information to tell which ingredients don’t cause acne.\nThe Beauty Brains blog seems to think that the comedogenicity ratings are of some value and suggests the following rule of thumb:\nSo if a couple ingredients with moderate to severe comegenicity scores [3 and up] show up on the first 5 or 6 ingredients in the formula, there may be cause for concern.\nThe guys who write the blog are cosmetic chemists, so I would take their word on this.\nCan you trust noncomedogenic claims?\nSo if you can’t judge whether a product causes acne from the ingredients list, how can you tell? I’m afraid that the answer in most cases is you can’t.\nSome manufacturers label their products as noncomedogenic, meaning it should be safe for people with acne. But you should take the claim more as a suggestion than a guarantee.\n‘Noncomedogenic’ is an unregulated term. So anyone can slap it on their products. It just means the manufacturer believes the product is safe for acne-prone skin, but they aren’t required to verify it. I’m sure many companies do test their products. After all, it damages their brand and reputation if a supposedly acne-safe products cause acne.\nPaula’s Choice gives the following guidelines while choosing acne-safe products:\n\nAvoid products with thick or overtly creamy texture. These are more likely to clog your pores.\nGels, light serums and fluids are more likely to be acne-safe than thicker products.\nOils don’t clog the pores but can make your skin appear greasy.\nAvoid products that contain irritants, such as alcohols, menthol, peppermint, eucalyptus, camphor, lemon, grapefruit, or lime as well as natural or synthetic fragrances.\n\nSince I’m not an expert on this topic I can’t say how good those guidelines are. However, I do see Paula’s Choice as a fairly credible source of information.\nThe ‘dark side’ of beauty\nYou’ve probably ran into posts exposing ‘the dark side’ of beauty. These articles detail long lists of unpronounceable and dangerous chemicals in your daily cosmetic and personal care products. These evil chemicals are said to cause cancer and disrupt hormones. After reading such articles I can’t fault you if you believe applying makeup is akin to poisoning yourself.\nThe solution.. of course, is to use natural, organic and ‘chemical-free’ make up.\nNow that you’ve gotten rid of all those nasty chemicals surely nothing bad can happen to you. After all, you are only using all natural, organic goodness. Like tea tree oil and lavender. Ooops.. can cause man boobs and hormone disruptions in pre-teen boys.\nWhat about all natural nettle then? Surely there’s nothing wrong with it. Oops.. causes man boobs and hyperestrogenism in women. How about this invigorating Chinese herbal tonic called Dong Quai.. man boobs again.\nBy the way, if you are wondering why all these have to do with man boobs.. it’s not because or my sexual deviations, but rather because I typed “gynecomastia herbal” into the PubMed search engine. Gynecomastia being the medical term for man boobs.\nAnd while they were bashing evil chemicals, did they also tell you that a massive study showed vitamin E supplements increase prostate cancer risk by 17% in healthy men? Or about this study that showed selenium supplements increase prostate cancer risk by a whopping 90% in men who are not deficient in selenium? Or did they talk about this rat study that showed antioxidants accelerate lung cancer development? No… well.. I suppose that’s ok.. you are still avoiding all those dangerous chemicals, so everything must be ok then.\nOK, enough with the sarcasm. The point I’m making is that ‘natural’ is not the same as safe. In fact, whether something is natural/organic has nothing to do with the safety of the product. What really matters is whether the product is safe and effective. Some natural products are, some are not.\n‘Natural’ and ‘organic’ are marketing terms designed to give you warm and fuzzy feelings and make you believe you are doing the right thing for yourself.\nBut really, is it true that cosmetics and personal care products have hormone-disrupting chemicals? And should I be concerned about those?\nYes, it’s true, sort of. Should you be concerned about them? Depends on how much of a worrier you are.\nThe whole issue of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in cosmetics and personal care products is very complicated. I mean like several orders of magnitude above my pay-grade.\nLast night, I read a few reviews that discussed the health impact of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals.\nIn the vast majority of the cases we are exposed to these chemicals well below established safety limits. However, there are concerns that these substances may not fit into the common assumptions in toxicology studies.\nSome of these chemicals may have ‘nonlinear exposure curves’, and data from exposures to higher concentrations may not accurately predict what happens at lower concentrations. In plain English, even exposures to small amounts may have negative effects. Is this true or not? I don’t know. It’s a question for people much smarter than me to figure out.\nAfter reading several reviews I got the impression that there’s no clear evidence that endocrine-disrupting chemicals cause any real harm for humans. That said, no evidence doesn’t automatically mean safe. Legitimate concerns exists and this area needs more research.\nIn 2009 both the Endocrine Society and the American Chemical Society issued statements that, I believe, capture the issue:\nThe Endocrine Society stresses the importance of the precautionary principle in the absence of direct information regarding cause and effect and considers the principle to be critical to enhancing reproductive and endocrine health. The American Chemical Society recommends more Green Chemistry research aimed at identifying and developing functional alternatives that do not have endocrine-disrupting activity. It remains, however, very difficult to determine which substances, at which point in time and at which concentrations, actually increase risk. Implementing the physical-chemical hygiene is in this context certainly indicated.\nEndocrine-Disrupting Chemicals: Associated Disorders and Mechanisms of Action\nI want to stress that these reviews go far beyond the chemicals found in cosmetics and personal care products. The chemicals covered also include pesticides, flame retardants, BPA and other chemicals found in plastics, etc. Exposure through cosmetics and personal care products constitutes only a small part of total exposure.\nAnd you should not assume that using natural products automatically solves this problem. As I mentioned above, many natural substances also cause hormonal disturbances. For example, phytoestrogens found in soy and some other plants are orders or magnitude more powerful than the much-maligned parabens.\nI should say that none of this applies to pregnant and nursing women. Exposure in the womb or infancy can have unanticipated effects later on in life.\nConclusion\nThis post turned out much longer than I assumed. So let’s see if we can pull everything together and actually conclude something.\nSo we started the journey wondering if it’s safe for people with acne to use makeup. Carefully chosen and properly used, I don’t see any reason why acne patients should not use makeup. Sure, some makeup can clog your pores and make acne worse, but that’s where careful selection and proper usage comes into play. A few studies have shown non-comedogenic and non-irritating makeup formulated for acne-prone skin is safe to use.\nI would go as far as to argue that makeup is good for your skin. Anyone who has experienced it knows how stressful acne is. The shame and anxiety it puts you through, all of which further aggravates acne. Anything you can do to ease the psychological burden is going to be good for your skin, and using makeup to hide blemishes is a very effective way to do that.\nIt’s true that some chemicals in cosmetics and personal care products may cause hormonal disruptions. However, in the vast majority of cases these are thousands of times weaker than phytoestrogens found in soy and other plants, which are further orders of magnitude weaker than human hormones. There’s no clear evidence that these chemicals cause harm in humans, however neither can we be sure they are safe. Following the precautionary principle, it’s a good idea to minimize your exposure to hormone-disrupting chemicals – without getting freaked out about them.\n\n    Toggle references    \n\nA History of Cosmetics from Ancient Times.\nA re-evaluation of the comedogenicity concept.\nPrepubertal gynecomastia linked to lavender and tea tree oils.\nGynaecomastia in a man and hyperoestrogenism in a woman due to ingestion of nettle (Urtica dioica).\nGynaecomastia and the herbal tonic “Dong Quai”.\nVitamin E and the risk of prostate cancer: the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT).\nBaseline Selenium Status and Effects of Selenium and Vitamin E Supplementation on Prostate Cancer Risk.\nAntioxidants accelerate lung cancer progression in mice.\nPersonal care products and endocrine disruption: A critical review of the literature.\nEnvironmental Oestrogens and Breast Cancer: Evidence for Combined Involvement of Dietary, Household and Cosmetic Xenoestrogens.\nEndocrine disruption: Fact or urban legend?\nHormones and Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals: Low-Dose Effects and Nonmonotonic Dose Responses\nEndocrine-Disrupting Chemicals: Associated Disorders and Mechanisms of Action\nModels in acnegenesis.\nInterest of corrective makeup in the management of patients in dermatology.\nEmotional benefit of cosmetic camouflage in the treatment of facial skin conditions: personal experience and review.\nCorrective camouflage in pediatric dermatology.\nEffects of skin care and makeup under instructions from dermatologists on the quality of life of female patients with acne vulgaris.\nMake-up improves the quality of life of acne patients without aggravating acne eruptions during treatments.\nThe role of cosmetics in postadolescent acne.\nEffects of cosmetics containing purified honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) venom on acne vulgaris\nDecorative cosmetics improve the quality of life in patients with disfiguring skin diseases.\n\n  \n\n\nDon’t Know How To Get Over Acne?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5768366e94c25d5de00c7325"},"Pinterest":"","authors_point_of_view":"favour","Comments":"","article_data":"\nEnvironmentalists and politicians and federal regulators have added environmental estrogens or endocrine disrupters to the “concerns” or scares that dictate “environmental health policy.” That policy, from its beginning, has been based on ideology, not on science. To provide some veneer to the ideology, its proponents have spawned bad science and junk science that claims chemicals in the environment are a major cause of human illness. There is no substance to the claims, but the current policies threaten to cost billions of dollars in wasted estrogen testing programs and to drive some substantial proportion of pesticides from the market. \nRachel Carson, conjuring up a cancer-free, pre-industrial Garden of Eden launched the biggest environmental scare of all in the 1960s. She charged that modern industrial chemicals in the environment caused human cancers. It mattered not at all to her or to her readers that cancers are found in every society, pre-industrial and modern. What mattered were opinions of people such as Umberto Safiotti of the National Cancer Institute, who wrote: \n\n\n I consider cancer as a social disease, largely caused by external agents which are derived from our technology, conditioned by our societal lifestyle and whose control is dependent on societal actions and policies.(1)\n\n\nWhen Saffioti said “societal actions and policies,” he meant government regulations. \nBy 1968, environmental groups and individuals—including some scientists—appeared on TV and on the floors of the House and Senate to say, over and over again, “The environment causes 90 percent of cancers.” They didn’t have to say “environment” meant pollution from modern industry and chemicals—especially pesticides—everyone already knew that. Saffioti and others had told them. \nIn the 1970s, the National Cancer Institute released reports that blamed elevated rates for all kinds of cancers on chemicals in the workplace or in the environment. The institute did not have evidence to link those exposures to cancer. It didn’t exist then, and it doesn’t, except for a limited number of high exposures in the workplace, exist now. So what? The reports were gobbled up by the press, politicians, and the public. \nIn our ignorance of what causes most cancers, the “90 percent” misstatement provided great hope. If the carcinogenic agents in the environment could be identified and eliminated, cancer rates should drop. NCI scientists said so, and they said success was just around the corner if animal tests were used to identify carcinogens. Congress responded. It created the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Both agencies have lots of tasks, but both place an emphasis on controlling exposures to carcinogens. Congress passed and amended law after law. The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, amendments to the Fungicide, Insecticide, and Rodenticide Act—the euphonious FIFRA—the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Resource Recovery and Control Act poured forth from Capitol Hill. \nAnd in return, EPA and OSHA, to justify their existence, generated scare after scare. They are aided by all kinds of people eager for explanations about their health problems or for government grants and contracts for research or other work or for money to compensate for health effects or other problems that could be blamed on chemicals. \nIn 1978, we had the occupational exposure scare. Astoundingly, according to a government report, six workplace substances caused 38 percent of all the cancers in the United States. It was nonsense, of course, and many scientists ridiculed the report, but the government never retracted it. The government scientists who contributed to it never repudiated it. \nAt about the same time, wastes disposed in Love Canal near Niagara Fall, NY, spewed liquids and gases into a residential community. The chemicals were blamed as the cause of cancers, birth defects, miscarriages, skin diseases, you name it. None of it was true, but waste sites around the country were routinely identified as “another Love Canal” or a “Love Canal in the making,” and Congress gave the nation the Superfund Law. Since its passage, Superfund has enriched lawyers and provided secure employment to thousands who wear moon suits and dig up, burn, and rebury wastes, and done nothing for the nation’s health. For those who doubt the importance of politics in the environmental health saga, it’s worth recalling that every state had two waste sites on the first list of sites slated for priority cleanup under Superfund. \nBy the 1980s, EPA was chucking out the scares. We had the 2,4,5-T scare, the dioxin scare, the 2,4-D scare, the asbestos in schools scare, the radon in homes scare, the Alar scare, the EMF scare. I’ve left some out, but the common thread that linked the scares together was cancer. Each scare prompted investigations by affected industries and non-government scientists. Each scare fell apart, revealed as a house of cards jerry-rigged from bad science, worse interpretations of the science, and terrible policy. \nIn fact, by the late 1970s, there was ample evidence that the much-talked about “cancer epidemic” and the 90 percent statement were simply wrong. Cancer rates were not increasing and rates for some cancers were higher in industrial countries and rates for others were higher in non-industrial countries. The U.S. fell in the middle of countries when ranked by cancer rates. Sure, there are some carcinogenic substances in the nation’s workplaces, but the best estimates are that they cause four percent or less of all cancers, and the percentage is decreasing because the biggest occupational threat, asbestos, is gone. Environmental exposures might cause two or three percent of cancer—on the outside—and they might cause much less. \nThe research into causes of cancer—not stories designed to bolster the chemicals cause cancer myth—did reveal that there are preventable causes of cancer. Not smoking is a good idea, as is eating lots of fruits and vegetables, not gaining too much weight, restricting the number of sexual partners, and, for those who are fair-skinned, being careful about sun exposures. It’s not a lot different from what your mother or grandmother told you. \nThe government can take a nanny role in urging us to behave, but that’s not where the big bucks are. The big bucks are in regulation, and regulation doesn’t seem to have much to do with cancer. \nIn any case, cancer death rates began to fall in 1990, they’ve fallen since, and the fall is growing steeper. Maybe that information is blunting the cancer scare. I somehow doubt it. I think that the public has become numb to the cancer scare or that it fatalistically accepts the notion that “everything causes cancer.” In any case, the environmentalists and the regulators needed a new scare. \nThe collapse of the cancer scare wasn’t good news to everyone. Government bureaucrats and scientists in the anti-carcinogen offices and programs at EPA and elsewhere have secure jobs. Congress easily finds the will to write laws establishing environmental protection activities, but it lacks the will or patience to examine those activities to see if they’ve accomplished anything. And, let’s face it, Congress doesn’t eliminate established programs. But the growth of programs slows, and money can become scarce, and that can squeeze researchers who depend on EPA grants and contracts to fund their often senseless surveys and testing programs. Moreover, the fading of scares doesn’t benefit environmental organizations that utter shrill cries about scares and coming calamities in their campaigns for contributions. \nHere’s an example of just how disappointed some people can be that cancer isn’t on the rise. Dr. Theo Colborn, a wildlife biologist working for the Conservation Foundation in the late 1980s, was convinced that the chemicals in the Great Lakes were causing human cancer. She set out to prove it by reviewing the available literature about cancer rates in that region She couldn’t. In fact, she found that the rates for some cancers in the Great Lakes region were lower than the rates for the same cancers in other parts of the United States and Canada. Here’s how she described the incident in a book she co-authored: \nColborn was puzzled. The high cancer rates she had heard so much about appeared to be more myth than reality. After months of chasing the specter of cancer, she found herself at a dead end. \nFaced with this major setback…(2) That’s what she wrote, “Faced with this major setback” It’s hard to imagine that the person who wrote that failing to find high cancer rates was a setback has public health or the interest of people at the core of her being. \nFailing to find cancer slowed her down but didn’t stop her. She knew that those chemicals were causing something. All she had to do was find it. \nAnd find it, she did. She collected every paper that described any abnormality in wildlife that live on or around the Great Lakes, and concluded that synthetic chemicals were mimicking the effects of hormones. They were causing every problem in the literature, whether it was homosexual behavior among gulls, crossed bills in other birds, cancer in fish, or increases or decreases in any wildlife population. \nThe chemicals that have those activities were called “environmental estrogens” or “endocrine disrupters.” There was no more evidence to link them to every abnormality in wildlife than there had been in the 1960s to link every human cancer to chemicals. The absence of evidence wasn’t much of a problem. Colborn and her colleagues believed that chemicals were the culprit, and the press and much of the public, nutured on the idea that chemicals were bad, didn’t require evidence. \nEven so, Colborn had a problem that EPA faced in its early days. Soon after EPA was established, the agency leaders realized that protecting wildlife and the environment might be a good thing, but that Congress might not decide to lavish funds on such activities. They were sure, however, that Congress would throw money at programs that were going to protect human health from environmental risks.(3) Whether Colborn knew that history or not, she apparently realized that any real splash for endocrine disrupters depended on tying them to human health effects. \nUsing the same techniques she’d used to catalogue the adverse effects of endocrine disrupters on wildlife, she reviewed the literature about human health effects that someway or another might be related to disruption of hormone activity. The list was long, including cancers, birth defects, and learning disabilities, but the big hitter on the list was decreased sperm counts. According to Colborn and other’s analyses of sperm counts made in different parts of the world under different conditions of nutrition and stress and at different time periods, sperm counts had decreased by 50 percent in the post-World War II period. \nIf there’s anything that catches the attention of Congress, it’s risks to males. Congress banned leaded gasoline after EPA released a report that said atmospheric lead was a cause of heart attacks in middle-aged men. The reported decrease in sperm counts leaped up for attention, and attention it got. Congressional hearings were held, magazine articles were written, experts opined about endocrine disrupters and sexual dysfunctions. \nAnd then it fell apart. Scientists found large geographical variations in sperm counts that have not changed over time. Those geographical variations and poor study designs accounted for the reported decrease. That scare went away, but endocrine disrupters were here to stay. \nWell-organized and affluent women’s groups are convinced that breast cancer is unusually common on Long Island. That may be true, and rumor has it that a very large NCI study will confirm a breast cancer excess. We know that obesity, estrogen replacement therapy, and late child-bearing or no child-bearing, all of which are more common in affluent women, are associated with breast cancer. Nevertheless, from the very beginning, environmental chemicals have been singled out as the cause of the breast cancer excess. The insecticide aldicarb, which is very resistant to degradation was blamed, but subsequent studies failed to confirm the link. A well-publicized study found a link between DDT and breast cancer, but larger, follow-up studies failed to confirm it. But there’re lots of environmental chemicals, and no evidence is required to justify a suggestion of a link between the chemicals and cancer. \nSenator Al D’Amato is from Long Island, and he shares his constituents concerns. During hearing about the Clean Water Act, Senator D’Amato heard testimony by Dr. Anna Soto from Tufts University about her “E-Screen.”(4) According to Dr. Soto, her quick laboratory test could identify chemicals that behave as environmental estrogens or endocrine disrupters for $500 a chemical. Since environmental estrogens seem to some people to be a likely cause of breast cancer, Soto’s test appeared to be a real bargain. \nSenator D’Amato pushed for an amendment to require E-Screen testing of chemicals that are regulated under the Clean Water Act, but he was unsuccessful. Later in 1995, a senior Senate staffer, Jimmy Powell, took the E-Screen amendment to a very junior Senate staffer and told her to incorporate it into the Safe Drinking Water Act as an “administrative amendment.” She did, it passed the Senate, and, for the first time, there was a legislative requirement for endocrine testing. \nIn the spring of 1996, House Committees were considering legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act and new legislation related to pesticides in food. Aware of the Senate’s action, some members of the House committees were eager to include endocrine testing in their legislation, but there was resistance as well. Chemical companies viewed the imposition of yet another test as certain to be an expense, unlikely to cost as little as $500 a chemical, and bound to raise new concerns about chemicals that would require far more extensive tests and research to understand or discount. \nFurthermore, so far as food was concerned, there was a general conviction that all the safety factors built into the testing of pesticides and other chemicals that might end up in food provided adequate margins of protection. That conviction was shattered by rumors that reached the House in May 1996.(5) According to the rumors, Dr. John McLachlan and his colleagues at Tulane University had shown that mixtures of pesticides and other environmental chemicals such as PCBs were far more potent in activating estrogen receptors, the first step in estrogen modulation of biochemical pathways than were single chemicals. In the most extreme case, two chemicals at concentrations considered safe by all conventional toxicity tests were 1600 times as potent as estrogen receptor activators as either chemical by itself. The powerful synergy raised new alarms. \nIn May, everyone concerned about pesticides knew that EPA had a draft of the Tulane paper, and EPA staff were drifting around House offices, but they refused to answer questions about the Tulane results. The silence signaled the expected significance of the paper. A month later, in June, the paper appeared in Science. It was a big deal. Science ran a news article about the research with a picture of the Tulane researchers. It also ran an editorial by a scientist from the National Institutes of Health who offered some theoretical explanations for how combinations of pesticides at very low levels could affect cells and activate the estrogen receptors. The New York Times, The Washington Post, other major newspapers, and newsmagazines and TV reported the news. If there was ever any doubt that FQPA would require tests for endocrine activity, the flurry of news about the Tulane results erased them. \nWhile the House was drafting the FQPA, Dr. Lynn Goldman, an assistant administrator at EPA, established a committee called the “Endocrine Disrupter Screening and Testing Advisory Committee” (EDSTAC) to advise her. Oddly enough, she appointed herself chairperson of the committee. In effect, Dr. Goldman’s committee will advise Dr. Goldman. The committee is big; there’re more than 50 members and assorted experts, and it meets in nice cities around the country—Miami next month. The committee is costing taxpayers about $20 million in travel, meeting rooms, reports, support staff, and so forth, but that is a bargain compared to what EDSTAC will recommend. \nRemember Senator D’Amato? He heard that Dr. Soto’s test cost about $500 per chemical, and he also heard that the myriad pesticides on the market are based on no more than 400 chemicals. All of those chemicals could be run through the E-Screen for $200,000. Granted there are a lot of costs that aren’t captured in the $500—often simply getting a chemical into solution so that the test can be run costs more than the test, and there are bound to be follow-on costs. Even so, getting the 400 active ingredients tested for a few hundred thousand dollars isn’t necessarily a bad deal. \nEDSTAC isn’t content with testing only active ingredients in pesticides, and it isn’t going to be limited to the E-Screen. The committee is considering tests for all of the 70,000 chemicals that it estimates are present in commerce, and it’s not limiting its recommendations to tests for estrogenic activity. It’s adding tests for testosterone and thyroid hormone activity as well as for anti-estrogenic, anti-testosterone, and anti-thyroid activity. The relatively simple E-Screen, which is run on cultured cells, is to be supplemented by some whole animal tests. Tests on single compounds will have to be complemented by tests of mixtures of compounds. The FQPA requires that “valid” tests be used. None of the tests being considered by EDSTAC has been validated; many of them have never been done. \nEDSTAC’s estimate of 70,000 chemicals in commerce is on the high side—some of those chemicals are used in such small amounts and under such controlled conditions that there’s no exposure to them. Dr. Dan Byrd has estimated that 50,000 is a more realistic number. He’s also looked at the price lists from commercial testing laboratories to see how much they would charge for a battery of tests something like EDSTAC is considering. Some of the tests haven’t been developed, but assuming they can be, Dr. Byrd estimates testing each chemical will cost between $100,000 and 200,000. The total cost would be between $5 and $10 billion. \nSince most of the 50,000 chemicals are commodity chemicals or chemicals that are no longer manufactured, the testing costs will have to be paid by the taxpayer. The FQPA requires that the estrogenic testing be completed in the third year after passage of the act in 1996. There’s no way the testing will be complete by summer of 1999at will happen, not even if the tests were limited to running 400 chemicals through the E-Screen. The failure to meet the deadline means that disgruntled citizens groups, upset because the testing is going too slow will sue the government. More taxpayer expense. \nAt some time, the tests will get done and results will be released. Groups of citizens, newly informed that they have been exposed to estrogenic or anti-estrogenic compounds, will sue manufacturers, distributors, and sellers of the compounds. Class actions will proliferate, and the $5 or $10 billion may seem to be a bargain in the blizzard of legal fees. \nWhen I first heard these projections, I thought EDSTAC and EPA will never go through with it. It costs too much and there’re too many uncertainties involved with the tests. In fact, I don’t think that EPA will launch a program to test all 50,000 chemicals. Instead, I expect EPA will launch a program to test a number of chemicals, and the program will never end. Government programs seldom do. Each year, EPA will add additional chemicals or additional tests. \nThe Tulane results played some major role in the passage of FQPA, the focus on endocrine disrupters, and Dr. Goldman’s establishment of EDSTAC. The Tulane results are wrong. Several groups of scientists tried to replicate the Tulane results. None could. At first, Dr. McLachlan insisted his results were correct. He said that the experiments he reported required expertise and finesse and suggested that the scientists who couldn’t repeat his findings were at fault, essentially incompetent. That changed. In July 1997, just 13 months after he published his report, he threw in the towel,(6) acknowledging that neither his laboratory nor anyone else had been able to produce the results that had created such a stir. \nWhether the initial results were caused by a series of mistakes or a willful desire to show, once and for all, that environmental chemicals, especially pesticides are bad, bad, bad, we don’t know. We do know that the results were wrong. \nNo matter, EPA now assumes as a matter of policy that synergy occurs. Good science, repeatable science that showed the reported synergy didn’t occur has been brushed aside. In its place, we have bad science or junk science. If the Tulane results were the products of honest mistakes, they’re bad science; if they flowed from ideology, they’re junk science. The effect is the same, but the reasons are different. \nThe estrogenic disrupter testing under FQPA is going to cost a lot of money and cause a lot of mischief. But the effects of that testing are off somewhere in the future. More immediately, a combination of ideology-driven science and congressional misreading of that science threatens to drive between 50 and 80 percent of all pesticides from the market. \nIn 1993, a committee of the National Research Council(7) spun together the facts that childhood developmental takes place at specific times as an infant matures into a toddler and then a child, that infants, toddlers, and children eat, proportionally, far larger amounts of foods such as apple juice and apple sauce and orange juice than do adults, and that pesticides can be present in those processed foods. From those three observations, the committee concluded that an additional safety factor should be included in setting acceptable levels for pesticides in those foods. Left out from the analysis was any evidence that current exposures cause any harm to any infants, toddlers, or children. No matter. \nMost people who worry about pesticides expected EPA and the Food and Drug Administration to react to the NRC recommendation by reducing the allowable levels of pesticides on foods that are destined for consumption by children. Maybe they would have. We’ll never know. In the FQPA, Congress directed that a new ten-fold safety factor be incorporated into the evaluation of the risks from pesticides. \nSafety factors are a fundamental part in the evaluation of pesticide risks. Pesticides are tested in laboratory animals to determine what concentrations to cause effects on the nervous, digestive, endocrine, and other systems. At some, sufficiently low dose that varies from pesticide to pesticide, the chemical does not cause those adverse effects. That dose, called the “No Observed Adverse Effect Level” (or NOAEL), is then divided by 100 to set the acceptable daily limit for human ingestion of the chemical. The FQPA requires division by another factor of 10, so the acceptable daily limit will be the NOAEL divided by 1000 instead of 100. Acceptable limits will be ten-fold less. \nDr. Byrd(8) has estimated that up to 80 percent of all currently permitted uses of pesticides would be eliminated by an across the board application of the 1000-fold safety factor. He cites another toxicologist who estimates that 50 percent of all pesticides would be eliminated from the market. The extent to which these draconian reductions will be forced remains to be seen, but pesticide manufacturers and users can look forward to a period of even-greater limbo as EPA sorts through it new responsibilities and decides how to implement FQPA. \nThere’s no convincing evidence that pesticides in food contribute to cancer causation(9) and none that they cause other adverse health effects. Restrictions on pesticides in food will not have a demonstrable effect on human health. On the other hand, the estrogen testing program and the new safety factor will drive pesticide costs up and pesticide availability down. \nSome manufacturers may lose profitable product lines; some may even lose their businesses. Farmers will pay more. They will pass those costs onto middlemen and processors, who, in turn, will pass them onto consumers. Increases in the costs of fruits and vegetables won’t change the food purchasing habits of the middle class, but they may and probably will affect the purchases of the poor. The poor are already at greater risks because of poor diets, and the increased costs can be expected to further decrease their consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables. \nThe National Cancer Institute urges everyone to eat five fresh fruits and vegetables daily. Those foods bestow some protection against cancer, and they take the place of the infamous “empty calories.” Everyone agrees fruits and vegetables are good for one and all. At the same time, environmentalists pressure Congress to impose additional restrictions on pesticides. Congress obliges, passes the responsibility to EPA, and EPA, in some fashion, will act. As the agency acts, food prices can be expected to increase. The irony in the name of the Food Quality Protection Act may come back to haunt us. Protected or not, quality food will become more costly. \n\nNotes\n1. Umberto Saffiotti quoted in Edith Efron, The Apocalyptics (Touchstone: New York, 1984), p. 84. \n2.

These chemicals are toxic for a number of reasons.  They may mimic estrogen, androgen or thyroid hormones and cause your body to respond to them inappropriately. Or they may block, stimulate or inhibit these hormones.  By interfering in your hormone system, there is growing evidence that these chemicals are responsible for a wide range of health problems.Endocrine disruptors are found in many products.  Sandwich bags, air fresheners, dryer sheets, perfumes, sunscreens, cleaning products, laundry detergents, flame retardants, pesticides, cosmetics, shampoo, conditioners and vinyl shower curtains can all be suspect.One widely known endocrine disruptor is bisphenol-A or BPA.  This chemical is found in plastics and is the reason many people choose glass water bottles over plastic.In February 2013, the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) released a new report:  State of the Science of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals 2012.  According to this study, endocrine disruptors are linked to high rates of endocrine-related cancers, such as breast, ovarian, prostate, testicular and thyroid cancers; low semen quality; genital malfunctions such as non-descended testes; adverse pregnancy outcomes; obesity; and Type 2 diabetes.But the effects don’t stop with humans.  The report also finds reproductive defects, infertility and antler malformations in some Alaskan deer populations and population decline in some species of otters and sea lions.Clearly, it’s a good idea to minimize your exposure to these chemicals.9 Ways to Avoid Endocrine Disruptors1. Reduce household fragrances.  Keep your house fresh and clean without using air fresheners.  Give your carpets and rugs a cleaning but remember to clean or change the vacuum filter first for maximum freshness.  Open the windows.  Put a bouquet of roses on the table.  If your home smells stale, put a few drops of essential oils on cotton balls and leave them around the house.  2. Throw out the dryer sheets.  Use homemade dryer sheets.  Combine ½ cup vinegar with 6-8 drops of grapefruit, orange, lemon or tea tree essential oils.  Spritz this solution on an old washcloth until moist and throw it in your dryer with your clothes.3. Use green laundry detergents.4. Use green cleaning products.  You can clean most things with vinegar, baking soda, pure soap and a little determination.5.\u0009Avoid perfumes.  Use essential oils or, better yet, use no scent at all.6.\u0009Choose your sunscreens wisely.7. Buy natural cosmetics.  Many cosmetics contain chemicals that may be endocrine disruptors but figuring out which ones are safe can be tricky.  There are many cosmetic ingredients and sources disagree about their hazards.  As a general rule, European standards are stricter than in the US so look for European brands.  In addition to changing your cosmetics, you can reduce your exposure to endocrine disruptors by using cosmetics less often.8. Use natural shampoos and conditioners.  Use vinegar or baking soda solutions to clean your hair.9. Store your food in glass.  Phthalates make plastics soft and are found in sandwich bags and other pliable plastics.  Fats absorb phthalates more easily than water, so be especially careful to store fatty foods in glass.  Avoid heating or freezing food in plastic because extreme temperatures release the phthalates.Endocrine disruptors have some serious health risks, but luckily some relatively simple product substitutions reduce your exposure to these chemicals.  For advice setting up your top 3 priorities to reduce endocrine disruptors in your life, give me a ring.  I’ll help you make your list.  And if you’re worried that you’ve had a high exposure to them, call me to make a plan to detox.  There’s no reason your shower curtain needs to be a health risk.\n\n\n\n\n0 comments\n\u0009\u0009\u0009        \n\n\n\ntweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0009\u0009\u0009      \u0009\u0009Filed under: Acupuncture, Burke, Springfield, Endocrine disruptors, Alexandria\n\n\n","Followers":"","title_name":"Endocrine Disruptors","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Sarah Shupe Hung","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"Jun 19 2014","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"My name is Sarah Shupe Hung and I'm a licensed acupuncturist working in Northern Virginia.

But exactly what harmful chemicals did we find in these cosmetics given to cancer patients?\nHere’s a snapshot:\n\nParabens: These chemicals are used as preservatives in numerous personal care products and may increase a woman’s breast cancer risk by disrupting her hormones. Methylparaben may also interfere with the effectiveness of a common breast cancer treatment, Tamoxifen.\nFormaldehyde releasers: These chemicals are used in many products as preservatives. They slowly and continuously release small amounts of formaldehyde, a known human carcinogen.\nPTFE: Commonly known as Teflon (yes, that Teflon), this ingredient is used in a variety of products to supposedly create a smooth application. PTFE can be contaminated with the possible carcinogen PFOA.\nFragrance: The catch-all term “fragrance” is in everything from sunscreen to lipstick and often hides cancer-linked chemicals as well as sensitizers—ingredients that can trigger uncomfortable side effects, like headaches and rashes, for women in cancer treatment.\n\n\nThat’s just a sample of the chemicals of concern we uncovered (Learn more here). And because no Look Good, Feel Better kit is the same—and personal care products are notoriously unregulated for safety—there’s no telling what’s in the kits you or someone you care about may receive.\nTake action TODAY and join the growing wave of people telling these industry giants to stop pinkwashing and start protecting women’s health. \n\nPrinter friendlyShare this: Facebook Twitter Email Gmail Yahoo!

They are made with a unique class of chemicals known variously as PFCs (perfluorinated compounds), PFASs (perfluoroalkyl substances), or simply Teflon chemicals. These compounds are designed to repel both oil and water, but with this special chemistry comes a special problem: they are so highly persistent that scientists call them \"virtually indestructible.\" And with their use over the last half-century, they have become global pollutants that threaten the health of people and wildlife.\nWhat products contain PFCs?\nPFCs are most famous for their use in making Teflon pans, but many products are made with these compounds [1], including:\nFood packaging, such as microwave popcorn bags and fast food wrappers.Stain-resistance treatments for furniture, carpets, and clothing.Non-stick cookware.Outdoor gear with a \"durable water repellent\" coating.Building materials.Aerospace, medical, and automotive applications.Many specialty items such as firefighting foams, ski wax, and industrial applications.\nHow am I exposed?\n\n\nPFCs have been released in large quantities from manufacturing\r\nfacilities for decades, and thus contaminate our food and some water supplies.\r\nPFOS and PFOA are breakdown products of a number of PFCs.\n Exposure also occurs from consumer products, house dust, and food\r\npackaging. \n\r\nGrease-resistant food packaging and paper products, such as\r\nmicrowave popcorn bags and pizza boxes, contain PFCs. PFOS was used until 2002 in the manufacture of 3M's Scotchgard®\r\ntreatment, used on carpet, furniture, and clothing.  PFOA is used to make DuPont's Teflon™ product, famous for its use\r\nin non-stick cookware.   PFCs are in cleaning and personal-care products like shampoo,\r\ndental floss, and denture cleaners.\n\n\nWhy should I be concerned?\nPFCs are extremely persistent in people, wildlife, and they environment, and some of them build up in people and animals. They migrate out of consumer products into household dust and air, are released by industries, and contaminate drinking water and food [2, 3]. Once they are in our bodies, they stick around—with half-lives in people of at least three years [4].\nExposure to these compounds has been linked to a number of health concerns:\n\nCancer: PFCs induce several types of tumors in laboratory animals, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer has designated PFOA as a possible carcinogen based on epidemiological evidence linking exposure to kidney and testicular cancer [5-7].Hormone disruption: laboratory animals exposed to certain PFCs show abnormal levels of hormones, including thyroid hormones and testosterone [8]. Children exposed to greater levels show reduction in hormone levels and delayed puberty [9].Liver toxicity: PFCs are associated with liver enlargement in laboratory animals [5].Harm to the immune system: recent research has identified the immune system as sensitive to PFCs in both laboratory and epidemiological studies. A 2012 study of 587 children found those with greater exposure to PFCs had significantly poorer responses to vaccines [10].Reduced birth weight: a number of large epidemiological studies have related higher maternal exposure to PFCs to lower birth weight [11]. These are consistent with laboratory findings of developmental toxicity.\nPFCs have been detected in drinking water all over the United States, including in Washington, and in both fresh and saltwater.\nNationally, the Environmental Protection Agency sampled public water systems around the country for six PFCs, among other unregulated contaminants, beginning in 2013 [12]. PFCs were detected in water from three Washington state water systems, serving more than 100,000 households.\nThe Washington state Department of Ecology sampled freshwater in Washington in 2008, finding PFCs in all water samples and elevated concentrations in water bodies impacted by wastewater treatment plant effluent [13]. University of Washington scientists sampled 15 saltwater and four freshwater Puget Sound locations between 2009 and 2011, detecting PFCs in all samples with the highest concentrations at sites near urban areas [14].\nWhat can government and industry do?\nPFCs have been produced, used, and disposed of essentially without\r\nregulation for the last half-century.\nRising levels of PFCs in the environment and increasing\r\ngovernmental pressure, however, have led to voluntary actions to reduce PFC\r\nproduction and use.\n In 2002, 3M ceased using PFCs for its signature product, Scotchgard®,\r\nbecause of concerns over release of PFOS and PFOA during manufacture and use.In early 2006, the EPA, Teflon™ manufacturer DuPont™, and seven other\r\ncompanies announced an agreement to reduce PFOA in emissions from manufacturing\r\nplants and in consumer products by 95% by the year 2010.\n While these actions are a step in the right direction, they do not\r\nadequately protect public health from the dangers posed by PFCs.\nThe state and federal government should act to phase out PFOA as well as\r\nchemicals that break down into PFOA.\nAs part of its Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics Program, Washington\r\nstate should complete a chemical action plan for PFOA and chemicals that break\r\ndown into PFOA.New federal legislation should include immediate action to phase out PFCs and other persistent toxic chemicals.\nHow can I reduce my exposure?\nAvoid purchasing or, at a minimum, limit use of products\r\ncontaining PFCs.Watch for packaged foods. Stay away from greasy or oily packaged\r\nand fast foods, as the packages often contain grease-repellent coatings.\r\nExamples include microwave popcorn bags, french fry boxes, and pizza boxes.Avoid stain-resistance treatments. Choose furniture and carpets\r\nthat aren’t marketed as “stain-resistant,” and don’t apply finishing treatments\r\nsuch as Stainmaster® to these or other items. Where possible, choose\r\nalternatives to clothing that has been treated for water or stain resistance,\r\nsuch as outerwear and sportswear. Other products that may be treated include\r\nshoes, luggage, and camping and sporting equipment.Check your personal-care products. Avoid personal-care products\r\nmade with Teflon™ or containing ingredients that include the words ”fluoro” or\r\n”perfluoro.” PFCs can be found in dental floss and a variety of cosmetics,\r\nincluding nail polish, facial moisturizers, and eye make-up. Avoid Teflon™ or non-stick cookware. If you choose to continue\r\nusing non-stick cookware, be very careful not to let it heat to above 450ºF. Do\r\nnot leave non-stick cookware unattended on the stove, or use non-stick cookware\r\nin hot ovens or grills. Discard products if non-stick coatings show signs of\r\ndeterioration.\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\nScientists Say Ditch Non-Stick and Waterproof Chemicals\n\n\n\n\nIt's Raining Teflon\n\n\n\n\nIs Your Stain-Resistant Carpet Clogging Your Arteries?\n\n\n\n\nA Teflon Tale (Tail) VIDEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument Actions\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n","Followers":"","title_name":"Perfluorinated Compounds (PFCs)","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.watoxics.org/chemicals-of-concern/perfluorinated-compounds-pfcs","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

However, new studies have surprisingly identified the flame retardant triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) in nail polish and the Teflon chemical perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in face creams.\nBelow are examples of chemicals of concern in cosmetics and personal care products, more information about TPHP and PFOA and how you can find safer products.\nChemicals of Concern in Personal Care Products\nCosmetics and other personal care products can include hormone disrupting phthalates used as fragrance binders, 1,4-dioxane, toluene, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), parabens, preservatives that release formaldehyde, quaternary ammonium products, mercury in skin lightening creams and lead in hair dye. These chemicals are variously associated with increased risk for cancer, liver damage, hormone disruption, asthma, allergies, reproductive problems and adverse effects on the brain.\nAnd there’s more. The antibacterial agents triclosan or triclocarban, often added to soap and other personal care products, are not necessary to fight bacteria and are water contaminants that are toxic to aquatic life. Nail polish and nail polish remover may contain solvents, many of which are brain toxins and associated with increased risk of cancer.\nFlame retardant in nail polish\nBack to triphenyl phosphate (TPHP). A recent study found the flame retardant chemical TPHP (also referred to as TPP) in 8 of 10 nail polish brands tested. Many nail polish manufacturers removed hormone-disrupting phthalates from their products because of health concerns, so they may be substituting TPHP as a plasticizer to improve flexibility. Two of the products did not list the chemical on the label. Researchers measured TPHP in women’s bodies after using these products, finding a sevenfold increase in the TPHP metabolite DPHP in urine 10-14 hours after use. The researchers speculate that solvents in the nail polish increase the absorbency of the chemical into the nail.\nTPHP is used in furniture foam as a component of the flame retardant Firemaster 550 and also as a flame retardant in plastic casings for electronics. There is evidence that TPHP causes hormone disruption and exposure is associated with reproductive and development problems. Men with higher levels of TPHP in their urine had poorer semen quality.[1] Zebrafish exposed to TPHP showed evidence of disturbed sex hormone balance.[2] There is also merging evidence that TPHP disrupts metabolism and may be associated with obesity.[3]\nTeflon Chemical in Anti-Aging Creams\nPolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is added to many anti-aging creams. The problem with PTFE is it’s often contaminated with toxic perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA. You may have heard of PFOA. It’s the Teflon chemical used in non-stick cookware. A recent study found PFOA in 6 of 17 PTFE-containing products tested.\nPFOA is extremely persistent in the environment and stays in the human body for years. Centers for Disease Control biomonitoring studies find that almost everyone has this chemical in their bodies. We are routinely exposed to PFOA in food packaging and non-stick cookware, but now we know that cosmetics are also a source. PFOA is a hormone disrupter associated with increased risk of cancer and reproductive problems. Higher levels of PFOA in women’s bodies were linked to increased risk of breast cancer.[4] One study found that higher levels of PFOA in blood were associated with delays in onset of puberty in girls, which could lead to reproductive problems later in life.[5]\nSafer Products Available\nAlthough many personal care products contain chemicals we’d like to avoid, safer products without toxic ingredients are now widely available in the marketplace. Consumers are advised to not purchase nail polish that lists TPHP as an ingredient or skin creams and other cosmetic products that list PTFE as an ingredient. In general, try to use fewer products and only purchase those with known safer ingredients.

People worked, lived and played near this facility and they produced a chemical called perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA or C8). Most people know of it as Teflon, commonly used in non-stick cookware, cosmetics and stain proof clothing. It’s a damning article to say the least. The thing that makes this article so relevant – for everyone – is that the Teflon chemical, is in nearly every single American.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said,CDC scientists found PFOA in the serum of nearly all the people tested, indicating that PFOA exposure is widespread in the U.S. population.”DuPont got into the business of making chemicals for everyday household goods because they used to manufacture weapons and had a bit of a public relations problem. They came under close scrutiny for over charging the federal government too much money for weapons, and so a PR man advised DuPont executives to get into the business of making chemicals for the era of “peacetime.” They transitioned away from weapons and into making products for homes across the country.Making sense of it all:It’s hard to understand why a company would do this to their workers, community and country. Having worked in this field for a while, here are some of my thoughts.Why did DuPont bring C8 to market if their own scientists warned them about major health and environmental threats?According to the Huffington Post piece, DuPont’s scientists knew as early as 1954 that C8 was toxic to human health and the environment. During the roll out of the “Happy Pan” coated with Teflon, the company’s own toxicologist warned it needed to be used with care.Greed is the most simple answer, but I think a sense of competition is the primary reason. DuPont knew the chemical worked wonders to make food not stick to the pan; a competitor came out with a similar product and they felt the need to jump. Without any federal regulatory program to require safety testing of the chemical, DuPont could easily bring the chemical to market, and in the homes of American families.The same broken system exists today, which is why chemicals like C8 are widely used in the marketplace.The chemical industry trade association unleashed two lobby blitzes to stop regulation of harmful chemicals.They are now in the middle of their third.This was the hardest part for me to read. Coming off the tails of a five year campaign to help reform our broken laws on toxic chemicals, my heart sank when I read about how the chemical industry trade association launched two successful and lobbying campaigns to stop reform of our toxic chemical laws. Reading that felt like deja vu. They are now in the final stages of their third lobbying blitz, and they have significantly weakened the reform proposals in D.C.According to the Huffington Post,When Congress passed a food-additives bill in 1958, chemicals already in use were presumed to be safe and grandfathered in.And goes on to say,By the early 1970s, Congress was once again debating how to regulate the chemicals that now formed the fabric of American domestic life. Both houses drafted legislation that would empower the Environmental Protection Agency to study the health and environmental effects of chemicals and regulate their use. But the industry unleashed another lobbying blitz. Under the final version of the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, existing chemicals were again grandfathered in.The problem is the chemical industry has NO credibility with the public, but Members of Congress still listen to them. WHY?Will Congress let the chemical industry get away with this, again?It’s too soon to say, but not if we act. Over the last six years efforts to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act have been full on. The 450 public health, environmental, consumer protection organizations and businesses that make up the Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families campaign have been unified in their support for passing laws to protect the public and environment from harmful chemicals. The ACC has been pushing their agenda to keep the industry as de-regulated as possible. And now it’s up to Congress, the U.S. Senate in particular, to fix the bill and pass a stronger TSCA reform off the Senate floor.A weak version passed the House of Representatives this spring, and the Senate is poised to take up an even weaker version. There is hope however, there is a possibility that Congress can take the best elements from each bill and fix some of the remaining issues to have a true compromise bill for the President to sign.To join this movement and tell Congress you want strong laws on toxic chemicals: TAKE ACTION HERE!What about “chemical cousins” like C6 – which are still on the market?Meaningful reform of the Toxic Substance Control Act would remove harmful cousin chemicals from the market as well. This is part of the reason we need a strong regulatory system in place to make sure companies don’t continue to make similar chemicals with similar health impacts.What safer products can I use in the meantime?Avoid non-stick pans, opt for cast iron or stainless steel. For a deeper dive on safer non-stick pans, scroll down to the “Safe Non-Stick Pans” section.Avoid stain resistant clothing, carpet and furniture treatments.Choose safer beauty products.It’s easy to feel hopeless, but if there is one thing I’ve learned in my days of working on this issue, it’s that when the public raises a ruckus, elected leaders HAVE to respond.TAKE ACTION today.Never miss a post and join my mailing list.Photo credits: Flickr CC (Classic Film)More from my siteNon-toxic microwave popcorn How to reduce heavy metal exposure from cosmeticsNon-toxic laundry detergent \u0026 dry cleaningSeven ways to tackle indoor air pollution ","Followers":"","title_name":"Making Sense of the Story Behind Toxic Teflon","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Lindsay Dahl","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"http://www.lindsaydahl.com/about-lindsay-dahl/","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.lindsaydahl.com/the-story-behind-toxic-teflon/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":278,"Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":"f-0, o-0"}

Implants create temporary, semipermanent, and permanent body modifications that transform the volume, space, and mass of a body area. Implants require an invasive procedure or surgery, often plastic or cosmetic surgery.\nPlastic surgery refers to surgical techniques aimed at reconstructing, correcting, or modifying parts of the human body. Cosmetic surgery is a subdivision of plastic surgery, which refers to any surgery that modifies a person’s appearance, but is not necessarily for a health-related reason. Cosmetic surgery makes it possible to replace, reconstruct, or reshape every external part of the body, from the cheeks to the buttocks. Examples of cosmetic surgery that utilize implants include facial, chest, buttock, and calf augmentations.\nFacial Augmentation\nChanging of the facial structure can involve a wide variety of implant practices, such as soft tissue, cheek, dental, and chin implants. These implants are used for reconstructive and cosmetic purposes. A common facial augmentation is to remove or improve the appearance of existing scars and facial lines. In the latter part of the twentieth century, many rigid and injection implants were developed; the most successful and popular types were soft tissue implants.\nSoft Tissue or Injection Implants\nSoft tissue implants include collagen, human fat and tissue, Botox, and Gortex. A common type of collagen implant is made from the deep surface of bovine skin. Bovine collagen implants consist of sterile, purified, reconstituted bovine collagen, which is injected into the dermal layers of the skin. The body absorbs collagen, resulting in a smoother skin surface. This type of implant lasts from four to ten months.\nExcess fat removed from the body can be injected into areas with wrinkle lines to reduce their depth. This procedure is called “fat grafting,” which utilizes a strip of a deep layer of underlying fatty tissue, which may be taken from any location on the body. The fatty tissue is then injected below or threaded into the wrinkle lines, where it may last for several years.\nX-ray of breast implant. Silicone gel was used in breast implants until 1992, when medical concerns led to its replacement with water-filled silicon bags.\nBotox is a safe liquid derived from botulism toxin. This type of implant paralyzes the muscles underneath facial wrinkles, thereby producing a smooth skin surface. Botox is effective for up to five months.\nGortex, a Teflon implant, is injected below wrinkle lines to produce a permanently smooth transformation of the skin’s surface. This substance is nontoxic and does not need additional surgery. This type of implant does not need to be repeated, but it can be removed whenever desired or if complications arise.\nCheek and chin implants have been used to reconstruct and reshape the face since the mid-twentieth century. The most common implants for these augmentations include both injection and rigid implants.\nRhinoplasty is a surgical procedure that modifies the size or shape of the nose. Early records, from about 600 B.C.E., refer to Sushruta, an Indian surgeon who implanted necessary cartilage structures and reconstructed noses that were amputated as a result of punishment.\nDental implants are used to replace, reconstruct, or enhance teeth or the jawbone. There is evidence that dental implants were used in early Egypt, where the upper classes replaced their teeth with those extracted from slaves, poor people, or animals. A wide variety of dental implants existed during the twentieth and early twenty-first century, and most involved surgical procedures.\nHair Grafts or Implants\nOne type of hair replacement is to use small hair grafts or implants, which typically vary in size from two to ten hairs. The grafts are placed in the scalp according to the natural hair patterns. Originally punch grafts were used that placed about ten hairs with each punch. By the late twentieth century, mini- and micro-grafts placed groups of one to four hairs at a time.\nChest Augmentation\nWhile both males and females have chest augmentation, the primary difference is that female augmentations are referred to as breast implants, whereas males have pectoral implants. Breast implants typically replace or enhance and increase the size of a female’s breast. Pectoral implants push the chest muscles outward, creating the appearance of a larger, more muscular chest.\nChest augmentation involves inserting implants into the chest. Silicone gel chest implants were invented by the plastic surgeons Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow in the early 1960s. This silicone gel implant was developed into a commercial product by Dow Corning in 1962. Other manufacturers introduced chest implants in the late 1960s. Chest implants were once filled with silicone gel, but it was banned in 1992 due to health risks. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) reported that silicone was linked to connective tissue diseases, such as arthritis and lupus. As a result, chest implants were modified to silicone bags filled with saline. Saline implants are shaped and sized according to the desired appearance, and the implant surface can be smooth or textured. Breast implants are either round or teardrop-shaped, while pectoral implants are more flat and circular. The type of implant used will usually depend on individual preferences.\nPenile Implant\nFirst used in the 1950s, the penile implant or prosthetic is a treatment for impotence. The penile implant is a set of prosthetic tubes within the penis designed to mimic the creation of an erection. There are three types of penile implants: the semirigid implant, the inflatable implant, and a self-contained inflatable implant.\nCalf Augmentation\nCalf augmentation enhances the calf muscle of the leg with the placement of a solid silicone rubber implant on the back of one or both calves. Men and women have calf augmentation to create more shapely calves or to produce symmetry, when one calf is significantly smaller than the other.\nButtock Augmentation\nButtock implants augment a flat posterior. The implant is placed in between the gluteal muscles, increasing and changing the shape of the buttocks. There are two types of implants to be used for this procedure: solid and cohesive implants. The solid buttock implant is made from a dense silicone, which is uncomfortable and lacks a natural appearance. The cohesive implant is made from a lighter, less-dense silicone gel, with additional flexibility. Both types of implants resist rupture, but the FDA has approved only the latter.\nTeflon and Surgical Steel Implants\nTeflon and surgical steel implants are primarily subcutaneous body art used by the Modern Primitive subculture. These implants take shape as horns, beads, gauged jewelry, organic shapes, and the like. Steve Haworth is a “3-dimensional body modification artist,” who invented the specialized instruments and procedures to place the Teflon implants just under the surface of the skin. The procedures used for these types of implants are invasive, but do not require any anesthesia (occasionally local anesthesia is used for more extensive implants). In 1999, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized Steve Haworth as the “Most Successful 3-Dimensional Artist” in the world.\nHealth Risks\nAs with most body modifications that require surgery, implants have associated health risks. Common risks include pooling of serum or blood, blood clots, infection, prolonged swelling, rupture, and loss of sensation. Cosmetic problems can also occur, such as rippling of the skin or undesired settling.\nSee also Body Building and Sculpting; Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery.\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nBabbush, Charles, ed.

As a result a lot of questions and uncertanties arise: How can CPV be implemented into daily business? How can companies assure the detection of unplanned deviations in the most economic way? Where are EU’s Guidance, ICH Q8 and CPV blending and how can they be merged and implemented most reasonably? Where does Statistical Process Control (SPC) fit into the CPV plan? The international conference Continued and On-Going Process Verification in Berlin is created to show best practice cases, answer all the pressing questions and provide networking opportunities.Bernd Bödecker (GMP Inspectorate of Hannover, Germany) talks about on-going process verification – EU regulatory expectations since the entry of the revised EU GMP Annex 15 into force. Aidan Collins (Eli Lilly Company, Ireland) covers a risk based approach to CPV. The topic María Jesús Alonso (Reig Jofre Group, Spain) is presenting will be APR/PQR in re-validation and technology transfer – implementing CPV into business. A business case for Stage 3: Continued/on-going process verification will be introduced by Ajay Pazhayattil (Apotex Inc., Canada).Ajaz S. Hussain (Insight, Advice \u0026 Solutions, LLC (Former FDA Deputy Director), USA) provides an insight into FDA’s trending new validation strategies.The workshop on the 2nd March covers QbD and Continued Process Verification, including exploring the regulatory landscape, building process knowledge – fact and risk based process design, reaction mechanisms and criticality of organisational structures in addition to the evolution of a CPV programme and opportunities for continuous improvement.For more information please visit:www.chem-academy.com/cpv\n\n\n\n\n\nEingestellt von\n\n\n\nStephan Mayer\n\n\n\n\num\n\n04:18\n\n\n\n\n\nKeine Kommentare:\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMontag, 10.

Jahrestagung Produktsicherheit in der chemischen Industrie“ vom 26. bis 28. Januar 2015 in Köln.Kreuzlingen, 18. Februar 2015 - Die Produktsicherheit ist seit Jahren eine umfassende Tätigkeit, die sich durch einen hohen Grad an Vernetzung ebenso wie eine stetig wachsende Komplexität auszeichnet. Eben diese Konstellation wurde auf der jährlichen Fachtagung besonders deutlich: Themen wie die Zukunft von REACH über 2018 hinaus, die Herausforderungen entlang der Lieferkette sowie die Überwachungsprojekte im föderalen System waren Schwerpunkte der mittlerweile 8. Jahrestagung in Köln.Fachbeiträge aus der Praxis führender Unternehmen und Institutionen wie der BAuA, Evonik Industries, Bayer, Clariant und Fuchs Petrolub gaben Antworten auf drängende Fragen zur wirtschaftlichen Umsetzung von REACH, nach der Einstufung und Umstufung von Gemischen nach CLP/GHS sowie zu den bevorstehenden Herausforderungen für Nanomaterialen und Endokrine Disruptoren. Das interaktive Format der Veranstaltung wurde besonders deutlich durch die Technik des Graphic Recording, bei dem parallel zu den Vorträgen nicht nur die Inhalte, sondern auch aktuelle Praxisfragen seitens der Teilnehmer anschaulich dargestellt und zusammengefasst wurden.

Fachtagung Fälschungssicherheit in der Pharmaindustrie“ vom 02. bis 04. März 2015 in Köln.Kreuzlingen, 11. Dezember 2014 – Das Fälschen von Medikamenten bleibt nach wie vor ein lukratives Geschäft, bei dem sich zunehmend mafiöse Strukturen herauskristallisieren. Selbst vermeintlich weniger interessante Generika und OTC stehen mittlerweile im Fokus der Fälscher. Der Marktanteil von gefälschten Arzneimitteln wächst stärker als das Geschäft mit Drogen, und die Folgen sind fatal: Sie berühren nicht nur die Wirtschaftlichkeit und die Reputation der Hersteller, sondern auch der Reimporteure. Mit der Falsified Medicine Directive (FMD) will die EU die Gefahr eindämmen und die Produktsicherheit gewährleisten. Die Pharmarichtlinie steht kurz vor ihrer Verabschiedung und wird demnächst in nationales Recht zu implementieren sein. Damit soll die Pharmaproduktion in Zukunft durchgängig serialisiert erfolgen, ein einheitliches System ist jedoch noch nicht endgültig verifiziert. Die Fachtagung der Chem-Academy befasst sich mit den zentralen Herausforderungen hinsichtlich der Fälschungssicherheit in der Pharmaindustrie. Fachbeiträge aus der Praxis führender Unternehmen und Institutionen wie dem Bundesministerium für Gesundheit, dem Bundesverband der Pharmazeutischen Industrie e.V., Merck, Pfizer und STADA Arzneimittel gibt die Fachtagung Antworten auf drängende Fragen nach der Sicherstellung der Lieferkettenintegrität sowie dem Aufbau eines erfolgreichen globalen Anti-Counterfeiting-Programms. Darüber hinaus werden die möglichen Lösungen zur Track\u0026Trace sowie der Status Quo der FMD diskutiert. Neuigkeiten zur Umsetzung der Europäischen Norm zu Tamper Evident Features runden das Angebot ab. Der interaktive Workshop beschäftigt sich mit den Anforderungen an die IT bei der Produkt-Serialisierung. Unter der Leitung von Dr. Frank Redeker von Pharmefficio Aachen behandelt der Workshop aktuelle und praktische Fragestellungen zu den Herausforderungen an die IT bei der Implementierung von Serialisierung im Unternehmen.  Informationen und das aktuelle Programm finden Sie unter: www.chem-academy.com/faelschungssicherheit\n\n\n\n\n\nEingestellt von\n\n\n\nStephan Mayer\n\n\n\n\num\n\n04:52\n\n\n\n\n\nKeine Kommentare:\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Followers":"","title_name":"Product Safety in Chemical Industry","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Stephan Mayer","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"https://www.blogger.com/profile/15786534897394341111","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://chem-academy.blogspot.in/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

You’re on the path to natural bliss, but there’s just one area left to tackle…\nMakeup!\nSwapping your regular makeup products for natural versions can seem like the scariest step in the transition. You found mascara that takes your eyelashes to new heights, a lipstick that makes your pout pop, and a foundation that makes your skin look like it traveled back in time. Why would you give those things up?\nUnder current law, the FDA doesn’t require cosmetics companies to conduct safety assessments on their products. Harmful ingredients can be easily masked under confusing or deceptive titles like “fragrance.” They may even be listed, plain and simple, on the label, but with no messages to inform consumers of their potentially harmful effects.\nIf makeup is a part of your daily routine, it’s vital to think about what you’re putting on your skin. Your pores absorb what you put on them—they don’t know any better! That lipstick on your teeth? You ate that.\nSo let’s talk about some toxic chemicals in the makeup and how to get healthy with our beauty routines!\n1. Phthalates\nPhthalates are a group of chemicals that may be disruptive to the endocrine system, which is responsible for hormone production. Such interference can lead to developmental, reproductive, and neurological damage.\nThe effects of phthalates may be related to their ability to mimic human hormones. A study by the University of Maryland reported that exposure to phthalates could cause reproductive abnormalities and decreased production of testosterone in males, as well as decreased male fertility. Other studies show a link between phthalates and premature delivery and endometriosis in women.\nWhere would you find phthalates? They’re used to plasticize products, making them more flexible or better able to hold in color and scent. From deodorant to nail polish to scented lip balm, the catch here is that these chemicals can be grouped under and listed as “fragrance.” Companies claim their fragrance formulas as “trade secret,” and thus don’t have to specify on the label which ingredients are included.\nYour best bet is to avoid products that list “fragrance” and choose ones that use plant oils and essences to give them the “yum” factor.\n2. Lead\nWe know that lead is bad for us. We stopped putting it in our paint, right? So why is it showing up in our foundation, lipsticks, and even whitening toothpaste?\nLead is a proven neurotoxin linked to miscarriage, reduced fertility, and delays in the onset of puberty for females. About seven years ago, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics found lead in over half of the 33 brands of lipstick they tested. A more recent study by the FDA tested popular brands and found 400 that contained up to 7.19ppm of lead.\nIt is inevitable that some lipstick ends up making it past the target area and into your belly. For those who wear it regularly, this could harm your health in the long run.\nHow does lead make it into cosmetics? It isn’t added as an ingredient, but rather makes its way in through contamination. Color additives are some of the most common sources.\nThe best way to avoid lead is to buy makeup from companies that make products in small batches and avoid contamination, or to buy products colored with fruit and other natural pigments.\n3. Quaternium-15 and Other Formaldehyde-Releasing Preservatives\nYou may already know that treated wood, such as particleboard, can release formaldehyde, but did you know to watch out for it in your makeup?\nWhen some chemicals break down, they release harmful formaldehyde gas, classified as a known human carcinogen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Researchers and the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\nThe main risk is through inhalation. The European Union (E.U.) mandates that formaldehyde-releasing preservatives in cosmetics be labeled as such if they exceed .05%. For those outside the E.U., we have to get savvy with our ingredient vetting.\nLook for:\n\nDMDM hydantoin\nBHUT (butylated hydroxytoluene)\nbronopol\ndiazolidinyl urea\nsodium hydrozymethylglycinate\nimidazolidinyl urea\nmethenamine\nquarternium-15, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-26\n\nQuaternium-15 is one of the more common ones, used in mascara, pressed powders, and eyeliners. In addition to potentially causing cancer, this ingredient can cause skin sensitivities and irritation. It belongs to a class of compounds called quaternary ammonium compounds, or “quats.”\nQuats have many uses—as preservatives, surfactants, germicides and conditioning agents. Choose products that use natural alternatives that perform similar functions such as rosemary, honey, tea tree oil, grapefruit seed extract, and vitamin E.\n4. PEG Compounds\nPolyethylene glycols, or PEGs, are petroleum-based compounds that are used to thicken, soften, and gelatinize cosmetics, making them a common ingredient in cream-based products. The main issue with PEGs is that they are often contaminated with ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane.\nEthylene oxide is a known human carcinogen, potentially harmful to the nervous system and human development. 1,4-dioxane is a possible human carcinogen that can remain in the environment for long periods of time without degrading.\nPEG compounds also enhance the penetration of other ingredients into your skin, which is great if these other ingredients are healthy, but not so much if they are harmful. The number next to PEG indicates how many units of ethylene glycol they comprise, such as PEG-4 or PEG-150. The lower the number, the more easily the product absorbs into your skin.\n5. Butylated Compounds (BHT, BHA)\nThis is another unhealthy ingredient that’s thrown into our products so we can keep them on our shelves for a longer period of time. BHA and BHT are used as preservatives in dozens of products.\nIn food:\n\nchips\nbaked goods\nbutter\nmeats, sausage, poultry\nchewing gum\nvegetable oils\nbeer\n\nIn your makeup and skin care products:\n\neyeliners, eye shadows\nlipsticks, lip glosses,\nblushes, foundations\nperfumes\nmoisturizers\nskin cleansers\ndiaper creams\n\nThese chemicals are endocrine disruptors, may induce skin allergies, and are linked to organ, developmental, and reproductive toxicity.\nThe E.U. prohibits the use of BHA as a fragrance and the European Commission on Endocrine Disruption lists it as a Category 1 priority substance due to evidence that it interferes with hormonal function. No thank you!\nThere’s evidence that suggests that BHT mimics estrogen, which can throw off hormonal function in both men and women. In some situations, this additive can promote the growth of tumors.\nBoth BHT and BHA bioaccumulate. Given the wide variety of food and cosmetic products they are used in, accumulation over time could lead to serious health consequences. Avoid these ingredients, and turn to products with natural preservatives instead, like aspen bark extract and vitamin E.\n6. Parabens\nThey’re practically famous. If you’ve heard of one class of ingredients you should avoid in your makeup, it’s parabens. They’re the most widely used preservatives in cosmetics, and they have no troubles penetrating your skin.\nThe European Commission on Endocrine Disruption lists parabens as Category 1 priority substances because of evidence they interfere with hormone function. I only let one thing toy with my hormones, and that’s the moon!\nParabens can mimic estrogen, and have been detected in human breast cancer tissue. They also interfere with reproduction, the nervous system, and the immune system—all things we would like to keep in well-working order.\nBecause parabens have gained such a bad rep, some companies now use phenoxyethanol, but phenoxyethanol is not the good witch of the north! It has many of the same harmful effects. Japan recently banned phenoxyethanol in cosmetics, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration put out a consumer alert warning that it can “depress the central nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea” in infants. Avoid both parabens and phenoxyethanol in your skin care!\nWe’ve already talked your ear off, so we’ll keep these last ones short. Put these ingredients on your radar:\n7. Octinoxate: Found in foundations, this is an unstable chemical linked with endocrine disruption and thyroid disorders.\n8. p-Phenylenediamine: A type of coal tar dye sometimes listed as CL followed by a five-digit number. It’s a respiratory toxicant and can be contaminated with heavy metals.\n9. Carbon black: An ingredient found in eyeliners, it’s linked to cancer and organ toxicity. Look for its other names: channel black, pigment black 6, pigment black 7, acetylene black, froflow, arogen, arotone, arovel, arrow, atlantic, and black pearls.\n10. Siloxanes: Used in cosmetics to soften, smooth, and moisten, they disrupt the endocrine system and are toxic to the reproductive system. Look for ingredients that end in -siloxane or -methicone and avoid these products!\nWe’re not here to scare you! We don’t want you to have nightmares that your future offspring will be jeopardized all because you wanted to sport a red lip, or that your loved one will get sick because you bought her an eye shadow palette for her birthday. But we have options when it comes to what we put on our faces and bodies. If the makeup industry isn’t going to make transparency a priority, we have to take it upon ourselves to do our research so we can make healthy choices.\nUpdate 3/5/2015: We made a short video that highlights that truth about the makeup industry. We want to change how this industry operates, but we need your help!

So why are some companies opting not to use them?By Best Health\nSource: Best Health Magazine, September 2012; Photo credit: iStockphoto.com\nWe all love silky, shiny hair, and makeup that will stay put even when we work up a sweat. The synthetic ingredient that’s responsible for those results is usually silicone. First introduced to beauty products in the 1950s, silicones are derived from a natural product called silica (basic sand), but undergo extensive chemical processing before being added to our beauty products. \nSilicones go by different names (dimethicone is one of the best-known) and are modified into numerous different formulas in order to perform the specific role expected of them’waterproofing, retaining moisture, adhering colour pigments, protecting our hair and imparting smoothness, and making the application of skincare products feel silky’no tugging on the skin as it is spread on, and no oily, sticky feeling. They give our deodorants that velvety feel, allowing them to dry quickly, and they keep water-resistant sunscreens on our skin, even when we sweat or get wet.\nThese are all good things. Why, then, are we seeing more and more products labelled ‘silicone-free’ or ‘no silicones’?\nThough studies show that silicone is safe for use on the skin, recent concerns arose regarding the possibility of silicones building up in the environment over time’that they are ‘bioaccumulative.’ Environmental activists now call for consumers to avoid them. David Suzuki lists siloxanes (forms of silicone) on his Dirty Dozen list of ingredients to avoid when purchasing personal care products. An Environment Canada review in 2008 concluded that certain siloxanes (D4 and D5) may pose a risk to the environment and have the potential to accumulate in aquatic organisms.\nSiloxanes D4 (cyclotetrasiloxane), D5 (cyclopentasiloxane) and D6 (cyclohexasiloxane), in use since the 1970s, came under review in 2009 by Health Canada, because they had initially been found to meet the criteria for being considered bioaccumulative and having inherent toxicity to non-human organisms. However, ‘Health Canada has concluded that all three siloxanes [D4, D5 and D6] are safe for human health,’ says Beta Montemayor, director of environmental science and regulation for the Canadian Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CCTFA), who adds, ‘The CCTFA is currently working with the government to work out reasonable risk management measures for the potential environmental concerns related to D4.’\nIn Europe, D4 has been classified as an endocrine disruptor. ‘However, says Christelle Legault, media relations officer for Health Canada: ‘Our screening assessment considered human exposure from uses of D4 and D5 in personal care products and cosmetics, but the scientific evidence showed they did not pose a risk to human health at current levels of exposure.’\nStill, many companies that position themselves as eco-friendly are choosing to create silicone-free formulas. One is Canadian brand Live Clean, which makes hair and skincare products. ‘While silicone originates from a natural source, it undergoes extensive chemical processing that leaves a huge ecological footprint and renders the ingredient ultimately synthetic,’ says Michelle Sparrock, executive vice-president of Belvedere International, which makes Live Clean. ‘Our goal is to keep synthetics to an absolute minimum.’\nCeleste Lutrario, vice-president of global research and development at Burt’s Bees, a natural line of beauty products that does not contain silicones, says from her office in Durham, N.C., ‘Silicones are not natural. We use blends of botanical oils and waxes, which work well in place of silicones.’\nYves Lanctôt, an independent chemist in Quebec who helps new cosmetic companies develop their products and keeps abreast of current industry research, acknowledges that silicones are not natural ingredients. But, he says, ‘they are non-toxic and very friendly for skin. They are safe to use even around the eye area. There are no studies I’m aware of to show that silicones represent a danger to human skin.’\nIn fact, it’s their skin-friendly nature and remarkable properties that make them so ubiquitous in our hair and skin products. When it comes to our hair, silicones are conditioning workhorses, says Jeni Thomas, Cincinnati, Ohio-based principal scientist at Pantene. They are in most of Pantene’s shampoos, conditioners and treatments, and many styling products; the most common are dimethicone and cyclomethicone. ‘They can repair signs of damage, fill in cracks and crevices in hair’s surfaces, return water resistance to damaged areas and prevent new damage from occurring.’\nThe amount and type of silicone used depends on the formulation, says Thomas. For example, ‘Pantene Fine Hair Solutions moisturizing shampoo and conditioner uses lighter-weight silicones than those designed for thicker hair.’ Silicones make hair easier to comb whether it’s wet or dry, which reduces the chance of breakage and split ends.\nSilicones have revolutionized the application and longevity of most makeup products, including foundation, eyeshadows, blushes, and liquid and pencil eyeliners. Says senior scientist for Cover Girl Sarah Vickery, who is based in Hunt Valley, Md., ‘Silicones are critical in many foundation formulations to give them more ‘spreadability’ and a luxurious, comfortable feel on skin. Common ones are cyclopentasiloxane and dimethicone. Silicones in liquid foundation help keep it flexible on the face and maintain a fresh, dewy look. Without their benefits, you could be left with dry powder on your face, which would be more likely to move into wrinkles or laugh lines.’\nVictor Casale, who is chief innovation officer with CoverFX, a Canadian cosmetics brand specializing in foundation and face powders, adds, ‘We use silicones to increase water resistance in a formula. This is particularly useful for sun-protection products, and foundations and powders, especially those that make the claim of being water-resistant and waterproof. We also use them to resist transfer onto clothing.’\nEven the lips are not immune to silicone’s charms. You know that favourite lipstick that lasts for hours? Another important property of silicones is their ability to act as a carrier for colour pigments. ‘If you want a high-performance, long-lasting lipstick, you need silicones,’ says Lanctôt.\nMany anti-aging skincare products use silicone elastomers. These are our friend when it comes to hiding the telltale signs of aging. ‘They are an innovative class,’ says Vickery. ‘They impart a soft, bouncy feel to the skin. They also optically help blur fine lines and wrinkles, so they have really advanced the anti-aging category.’ Silicone elastomers appear on a label as cyclomethicone and dimethicone cross-polymer.\nWhile Lanctôt acknowledges that the process to transform silicone for use in beauty products is man-made, there is no product he knows of that can produce the same results and still claim a ‘natural’ title. ‘It’s impossible,’ he says.\nHealth Canada and Environment Canada continue to monitor and study the use of ingredients like silicones in personal care products. The CCTFA assures us that personal care products must meet all safety standards set by regulatory authorities such as Health Canada, the FDA in the U.S., and the European Commission. In addition, companies are continually working to develop new modified silicones.\nIf you’re looking to identify silicones on a product label, they generally end in ‘-cone,’ ‘-conol,’ or ‘-siloxane,’ according to Lanctôt.

The unique fluid properties of silicone give it a great deal of slip, and in its various forms it can feel like silk on skin, impart emollience, and be a water-binding agent that holds up well, even when skin becomes wet. In other forms, it’s used extensively for wound healing and for improving the appearance of scars. [1] There are numerous forms of silicones used in cosmetic products, particularly leave-on skincare products and all manner of hair-care products. Common forms of silicone are cyclopentasiloxane and cyclohexasiloxane; other forms include various types of dimethicone and phenyl trimethicone. Claims that silicones in any form cause or worsen acne have not been substantiated in published research, nor have reports that silicones are irritating to or “suffocate” skin. Almost all of these claims are either myths or based on anecdotal evidence, which isn’t the best way to determine the safety or efficacy of any cosmetic ingredient. How do we know that silicones don’t suffocate skin? Because of their molecular properties they are at the same time porous and resistant to air. Think of silicones in a skincare formula like the covering of a tea bag. When you steep the tea bag in water the tea and all of its antioxidant properties are released. Silicones remain on the surface of your skin and the other ingredients it’s mixed with “steep” through. All ingredients must be suspended in some base formula; some of the ingredients remain on the surface, some are absorbed. The intent is for the “actives” to get through. Think of how many topical medications are suspended in petrolatum or mineral oil and the active ingredients absolutely get through, and petrolatum is far more effective at preventing moisture loss than silicones are. Moreover, the molecular structure of commonly used silicones makes it impossible for them to suffocate skin (not to mention skin doesn’t breathe). The unique molecular structure of silicones (large molecules with wide spaces between each molecule) allows them to form a permeable barrier and also explains why silicones rarely feel heavy or occlusive, although they offer protection against moisture loss. [2] Interestingly, silicone has been shown to be helpful for offsetting dryness and flaking from common anti-acne active ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide and topical antibiotics. [3] Also, silicones are sometimes used as fillers to improve the appearance of acne scars, which certainly wouldn’t be the case if silicone were a pore-clogging ingredient. [4] Perhaps the most telling reason why silicones do not clog pores and cause acne (or blackheads) is because, from a chemistry standpoint, most silicones are volatile. That means their initially viscous (thick) texture evaporates quickly and does not penetrate the pore lining where acne is formed. Instead, they help ensure the even application of other ingredients and leave behind a silky, almost imperceptible feel that noticeably enhances skin’s texture and appearance—without irritation. \nReferences Cited:\n\nKlopp R, Niemer W, Fraenkel M, von der Weth A.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5768366e94c25d5de00c733b"},"tag_v1":["Methicone","Silicone"],"Pinterest":"","authors_point_of_view":"favour","Comments":50,"article_data":"I had been reading some online forums from various sources recently about silicones in skincare and beauty products and how they are bad for the skin. I have been curious about it for a while, because this discussion about whether silicone is good or bad for the skin has been going on for some time.\n\nSilicone is a chemically derived product with occlusive qualities. What this means in terms of skincare is that covers the skin to protect and keep the moisture in. By doing so, silicone also fills in uneven skin texture like fine lines and acne scars so it gives the illusion of great skin when foundation is applied over it. This is why most makeup primers in the market will contain silicones because it helps the primer do its work i.e. prime the skin for makeup.\nTo identify silicone in a product, look for Dimethicone or methicone in the ingredient list (definition). In fact, the general rule of thumb is that anything ending in “cone” is likely to be silicone. Opinions however are divided as to whether silicone is indeed good or bad for the skin.\nSilicone is good for the skin\nProponents of the use of Silicone in skincare say that silicone is not bad for the skin. The molecules in Dimethicone are too large to penetrate into the skin layers and only sit on top of the skin. By having this silicone layer on top of the skin, the skin moisture is prevented from escaping, thus helping keep the skin moisturized. Silicone in skincare is also supposed to be better for those with sensitive skin due to this occlusive nature and it does not irritate the skin nor does it cause acne.\nIn the beauty world, Dimethicone is commonly used in primers and liquid foundations because it fills up imperfections in the skin and creates a smooth canvas for the foundation to go on. Just think of putting on makeup like painting a wall and you’ll get the general idea. If you use long wearing or waterproof makeup, chances are is that it contains silicones too because silicone repels water and sweat. (source) Silicones are also present in oil-control or mattifying products so you will notice that some products with silicone give a matte look to the skin. I reckon it is because it is holding the oil in under the layer of silicone so you don’t notice it so much.\nIn hair products, silicone is commonly found in hair serums and conditioners. It is what gives that shine to the hair and makes it feel smooth and soft. The principle is pretty much the same. The silicone coats the hair so it feels and looks soft and smooth.\nSilicone is bad for the skin\nOn the other side of the fence are the detractors who say that silicones are in fact bad for the skin. Because the silicone sits in a layer on top of the skin keeping in moisture, it also keeps in any sebum, dirt and bacteria that may already be on the skin. Once the skin is irritated, it will breakout. So, it is common to hear people say that silicones in products break them out. (source)\nAlso, prolonged use of silicones may also lead to allergic reactions and may cause sensitive skin to react adversely.  So, eczema flareups may occur and on the face acne or spots will form. I thought about it and this may be one of the reasons why my hair conditioner caused my acne. Also, large doses of silicone can be toxic.\nSome people who complain that certain skincare serums or moisturizers break them out, or that they have foundations or primers causing spots and acne may be allergic to silicones or react to them.\nShould I avoid products with Silicone?\nOn a personal note, I think avoiding products with silicone in them is not so easy. So many products these days have some element of silicone in it – the question is how much silicone will irritate your skin. However, if you find that certain products that contain silicone ingredients break you out, then you might want to stop using it and any other product containing silicone altogether.\nI believe that the large majority of the population can tolerate silicone in products to a degree, depending on its quantity found in the product in question. In my case, I don’t really have very sensitive skin and I find that most products, even those containing silicone don’t cause breakouts. In my regular skincare routine, I’ve discovered that silicones are present in the Body Shop Vitamin C Skin Boost, Eucerin White Solution Sunscreen, Olay Total Effects moisturizer and Eucerin Hydro-Balance Refreshing Cream. However, these 4 products work well for me and I have no intention of discontinuing their use for now.\nBy contrast, silicones in Tresemme hair conditioner broke me out badly and so did the silicones in Redken’s Extreme Anti-Snap hair serum. It only took me a few days use to notice the breakouts on my face from coming into contact with the products. I think there may be more silicones in hair products than in skincare because hair conditioners and serums tend to feel more slippery, a sure sign of presence of silicones.\nFor myself, I ensure that I cleanse my skin well in the evenings to remove all traces of my makeup and skincare used in the day and for this, double cleansing works for me. In the morning, I also wash my face with a gentle facial cleanser before I put on any skincare. I don’t know if its enough, but since it works for me, I’ll continue doing what I do. Viva Woman also wrote an article about silicones which I found useful too.\nIn skincare, silicone is commonly found in serums and moisturisers.\nIn makeup, silicone is commonly found in primers and liquid foundations.\nIn hair products, silicone is commonly found in serums and conditioners.\nDisclaimer\n\nMore posts you might enjoy\n Share65 Pin8 Tweet5 +13Shares 81","Followers":"","title_name":"What is Silicone and is it bad for your skin?","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Paris B","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":65,"Date":"24/09/2008","Fb_Link":"https://www.facebook.com/MyWomenStuff/","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":8,"Links":"http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2008/09/what-is-silicone-and-is-it-bad-for-your-skin/","type":"blog","Twitter":5,"Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":"f-10, o-2"}

Why are so many products suddenly using it, and should you be concerned?\nWhat is Dimethicone?\nDimethicone (also known as polydimethylsiloxane or PDMS) is technically called a silicone-based polymer. More simply, it’s a silicone oil with certain properties that make it extremely popular in today’s personal care properties.\nWhat companies really like about this ingredient is that it provides a smooth application. For skin care products, it fills in uneven texture and fine lines, which helps create a smooth and flawless look in products like primers, foundations, and lotions. It also provides a protective cover on skin, which is supposed to help keep moisture in, leaving skin hydrated for longer.\nIn hair care products, dimethicone is used to provide smoothness, particularly in conditioners and detanglers, where the ingredient helps smooth hair and provide better comb-through. Because dimethicone leaves a sort of covering on the hair strands, it can also make hair appear shinier.\nIs it Safe?\nThe FDA approved dimethicone for personal care products, and it is generally considered to be safe to use. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) also evaluated the scientific data and concluded that it was safe for use in cosmetics. The Skin Deep Database also marks this ingredient with a low hazard rating. The only possible side effects listed are dryness, slight irritation, and allergic reactions.\nThis tells us little, however, about what this ingredient may do to the skin. Scientifically, it may not cause cancer or other obvious harm, but should you be applying this ingredient every day to your skin? I’m hoping you don’t!\nWhat are the Concerns?\nThe first concern with this ingredient is that it covers the skin. Manufacturers may think that’s a benefit, but I don’t. Imagine having a thin, rubber-like cover over your face all day. Sound healthy? It’s not.\nNot only are you missing out on truly moisturizing ingredients like natural oils, extracts, and shea butter, but you’re interfering with the skin’s natural processes, like sweating, temperature regulating, sloughing off dead skin cells, and the like. Prolonged exposure can increase skin irritation and create a dependency on the product. Just like petroleum jelly, dimethicone can actually end up drying your skin the more you use it, as it interferes with the natural hydrating processes, making fine lines and wrinkles more noticeable.\nHere’s something even worse: Have you noticed, since using these new products with dimethicone, that your skin is breaking out more? No surprise, as the covering and trapping property of dimethicone means that it’s not just trapping moisture, but bacteria, skin oils, sebum, and other impurities. That means those prone to acne or with oily skin are more likely to see increased blackheads and breakouts when using products containing this ingredient.\nThere is also some concern that dimethicone is hurting the environment. It is non-biodegradable, which means that it can pollute our environment during both the manufacturing process and after it’s used, in the disposable process.\nWhat to Do?\nYour skin doesn’t need chemicals to look healthy and smooth. The way to truly beautiful skin is to nourish it, both inside and out. Avoiding this product is simple and complicated at the same time. Simple, because you can find it (and related cousins listed below) by simply reading the ingredient deck. Complicated, because you’ll find this ingredient in thousands of products out there.\nThe answer? Purchase your skin care products from conscientious manufacturers who care about using truly nourishing ingredients. As for hair care products? The ingredient is less likely to cause any personal adverse effects when used on the hair, as long as you don’t soak in it (as in a bath) afterwards.\nOh, and by the way, you already knew, but Annmarie Gianni Skin Care stays completely away from dimethicone and any other silicone products.\n\nMethicone\nPhenyl trimethicone\nDimethicone\nCyclomethicone\nDimethiconol\nDimethicone copolyol\n\nDid you experience more acne breakouts when using products that contain this ingredient?

What is this ingredient, and should you avoid it?\nWhat is Dimethicone?\nDimethicone is what the chemists like to call a silicon-based polymer—”polymer” meaning it’s a large molecule made up of several smaller units bonded together. Simply put, it’s a silicon oil, man-made in the laboratory and used in personal care products as an anti-foaming agent, skin protectant, and skin and hair conditioner.\nManufacturers like it because it makes products easily spreadable, so you get that feeling of the lotion or cream gliding over your skin. Dimethicone also helps form a protective barrier on the skin, and can fill in the fine lines and wrinkles on the face, which is why it’s often used in makeup primers.\nIs Dimethicone Safe?\nThe FDA has approved the use of dimethicone as a skin protectant ingredient in over-the-counter products, and the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) panel has assessed it as safe to use in personal care products. Some studies have found it to soothe and help improve chronic hand dermatitis, and to help reduce inflammation and irritation. The Skin Deep Database also lists it has have a low hazard risk.\nFor me, though, this is not a good ingredient to be using in your daily skin care. Like petroleum products, silicone oils can actually make dry skin worse over time. Instead of sinking into your skin and nourishing it from the inside out, like healthy ingredients do, it forms a sort of plastic-like barrier on the outside of skin.\nWhy Dimethicone is Bad for Your Skin\nThat artificial coating on the outside of skin causes several issues:\n\nIt traps everything under it—including bacteria, sebum, and impurities—which could lead to increased breakouts and blackheads\nThe coating action actually prevents the skin from performing its normal activities—like sweating, temperature regulating, sloughing off dead skin cells, etc.\nProlonged exposure to dimethicone can actually increase skin irritation, due to the coating property and because dimethicone is listed as a possible skin and eye irritant\nThose with sensitive or reactive skin are at risk of an allergic reaction to dimethicone\nOn top of all this, dimethicone is a non-biodegradable chemical—bad for the environment\n\nI also believe that using these types of ingredients on your skin can actually exacerbate skin aging. Why?\n\nYou’re inhibiting skin’s natural processes\nYou’re creating a dependency on the coating product, disrupting the skin’s own hydrating processes, which in the end increases dryness, making fine lines and wrinkles more noticeable\nThe coating properties may increase breakouts, particularly if you’re susceptible to acne, which will lead to scars and older-looking skin\nYou’re doing nothing to boost the health and vitality of the skin, thus letting aging take its toll\n\nMuch better to use nourishing ingredients that help keep your skin hydrated naturally! (Speaking of, check out my new skin care line here!)\nTo avoid this ingredient, stay away from all dimethicone and similar ingredients like cyclomethicone, dimethiconol, and phenyl trimethicone.\nWhat do you think of dimethicone? Has it caused you to break out?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5768366e94c25d5de00c733e"},"tag_v1":["Endocrine disruptors","Parabens"],"Pinterest":"","authors_point_of_view":"against","Comments":"","article_data":"\n\n\nby guest blogger Ava Anderson, natural beauty expert and safe cosmetics advocate\nI always say that it is all about the ingredients, and I recommend using products without harmful ingredients in order to reduce your daily, weekly, yearly, and lifetime body burden of chemicals with known and suspected disease implications. Since up to 60 percent of what you put on your skin reaches your bloodstream (this increases to almost 100 percent with scalp, underarm, and groin exposure), it makes sense to use cosmetics that DO NOT add to your body burden of toxic chemicals.\nOver time, you should replace all harmful personal care products, but here are three cosmetics we recommend tackling first:\n1. Foundation. Foundation is a good place to start, as many women cover their whole face and neck with it daily. Liquid foundations contain many harmful chemicals, including the following, found in a major drugstore brand: propylene glycol, methylparaben, and propylparaben, all of which are considered endocrine disruptors. These are important to avoid because the endocrine system regulates ALL biological processes in the body, including development of the brain and nervous system, growth and function of the reproductive system, and metabolism and blood sugar regulation, as well as the functions of the ovaries, testes, pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN recently released a report calling endocrine disruptors a \"global threat\" to fertility and the environment. In 2011, another shocking study showed that methylparaben along with an endocrine disruptor widely found in food, BPA, turned healthy cells into cancer cells and rendered the breast cancer drug tamoxafin ineffective.\nThe same brand also contains ingredients that have the potential to be contaminated with cancer causers: PEG/PPG 10 dimethicone, PEG/PPG 18, retinyl acetate, tocopheryl acetate, laureth 7, and PEG/PPG 20 dimethicone.\nLoose powders and brush-on foundations, which are applied topically, not only have the endocrine disruptors methylparaben, propylparaben, but have other ingredients of concern, too. One best seller (and many similar products) contains retinyl acetate, alumina (suspected of being neurotoxic), and other hazardous ingredients that can be inhaled.\nLook for products without these ingredients. Our AvaFACE foundation, formulated with French clay, silk, and organic arrowroot powder is one such product.\n2. Lipstick. According to a recent piece by The New York Times, \"Millions of women and girls apply lipstick every day. And not just once: some style-conscious users touch up their color more than 20 times a day.\"  A recent study also found that \"a wide range of brands contain as many as eight other metals, from cadmium to aluminum.\" Those will never appear on a label because they are contaminants of other ingredients. Besides endocrine disruptors like propylparaben, other harmful substances in typical department store and drugstore lipsticks are as tocopheryl acetate and retinyl acetate, as well as titanium dioxide, which usually exists in nanoparticle form. Nanoparticles have been shown to cross the cell barrier and drive into organs, including the brain in humans, where they can cause long-term oxidative damage. There is no way of knowing what size particles are in your product unless the manufacturer tells you.\nSo, what's the solution? Organic lipstick with as few harmful chemicals as possible.\n3. Mascara. With toxic ingredients like these from a best-selling major brand of mascara, you can see why it is important to find an organic alternative that still delivers results: triethanolamine (which reacts with other ingredients in products to become carcinogenic nitrosodiethanolamine), propylene glycol, methylparaben, butylparaben, quaternium 15 and quaternium 22 (both of which release cancerous formaldehyde as they break down), and synthetic colorants that have been linked to organ-system toxicity.\nI hope you will replace your conventional products, starting with these three, and opt for safer choices. If you combine the ingredients lists above, you can see how just a few products can contribute to your daily chemical body burden. There are seven parabens in just one single daily application of lipstick, foundation, and mascara and we ladies know we apply these more than once every day.\nAt the age of 15, Ava Anderson launched her own line of personal care and home-cleaning products, Ava Anderson Non-Toxic. Now 19, Ava is educating tens of thousands of American families on the issue of toxic chemicals in personal care products through her line, which now includes baby, skin, face, hair, body, scents, bugs, candles, home, sun, and pet products. This fall, Ava will be a sophomore at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and will also actively help run her multimillion-dollar empire with 12 full-time employees. Her goal is to help force a paradigm shift on the issue of toxic chemicals in cosmetics.\nFor more from Maria Rodale, visit www.mariasfarmcountrykitchen.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Maria Rodale on Twitter:\nwww.twitter.com/farmkitchenblog\n\n\nMore:\nMakeup Maria's Farm Country Kitchen Maria Rodale Cosmetics Ava Anderson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Blogger's Books and Other Items from...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganic Manifesto: How Organic Food Can Heal Our Planet, Feed the World, and Keep Us Safe\nby Maria Rodale\n\n\n\n\n\nMaria Rodale's Organic Gardening Secrets: The Complete Four Season Guide\nby Maria Rodale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE AND FOLLOW\n\n\n\nGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

Almost every cell in the body is affected by the endocrine system. A recent report from the Environmental Working Group states, “There is no end to the tricks that endocrine disruptors can play on our bodies—increasing production of certain hormones, decreasing production of others, imitating hormones, turning one hormone into another, interfering with hormone signaling, telling cells to die prematurely, competing with essential nutrients, binding to essential hormones, and accumulating in organs that produce hormones.”\nTherefore, chemicals that disrupt our hormones can upset our entire systems—an issue recently highlighted by a joint report released last march by The United Nations and World Health Organization stating that, “Endocrine Disruptors (EDC’s) are a global threat to fertility and the environment.”\nKeeping in mind that a good percentage of what we inhale and absorb can reach the bloodstream and consequently our endocrine system, I advise avoiding the following endocrine disruptors to reduce your body’s burden:\n1.      Phthalates (THAL-ates)—legally hidden in trade-secret ingredient “fragrance” or “parfum.” More than 75 percent of all products with the ingredient fragrance are tested to contain phthalates, which comes as no surprise, as phthalates are used to extend the life and reach of the secret synthetic scent. Studies have linked phthalates to diabetes, obesity, lower sperm count, birth defects in male reproductive system, early puberty, breast cancer, demasculinization of males, thyroid irregularities, autism and ADHD. AVOID: any product inhaled or absorbed with ingredients listed as “fragrance” or “parfum.”\n2.     Parabens—known to disrupt hormone function, an effect linked to increased risk of breast cancer and reproductive toxicity. Parabens mimic estrogen by binding to estrogen receptors on cells. They also increase the expression of genes usually regulated by estradiol (a natural form of estrogen); these genes cause human breast cancer cells to grow and multiply in cellular studies, says the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics. In addition, parabens are linked to cancer, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and skin irritation.\nAVOID:  methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, isopropyl-, and all other parabens.\n3.      Chemical sunscreen filters—including oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate, and octinoxate. Over the past decade dozens of studies have examined the potential health hazards of these sunscreen chemicals, including possible skin irritation or allergy, hormone disruption, and skin damage that occurs when sunlight acts on sunscreen chemicals, according to the Environmental Working Group. AVOID: above chemicals, and look for “NON-nanoparticle” zinc oxide–based sunscreens, without other added harmful chemicals.\n4.     Triclosan—an antimicrobial chemical, registered with the government as a pesticide. Triclosan has been linked to antibiotic resistance and is a known hormone disruptor that has been shown to alter male and female sex hormones in animal studies, which could lead to problems like early onset puberty, reduced fertility, and cancer. Triclosan accumulates in the environment, contaminating surface and ground water, and it survives the wastewater treatment process and persists in “toxic sludge” that is sold to local farmers as “natural fertilizer.” AVOID: triclosan and triclocarban\n5.      Perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs)—fluorine-containing chemicals with unique properties to make materials stain and stick resistant. Found in grease-resistant food packaging, nonstick cookware, and personal care products like shampoo, dental floss, nail polish, and denture cleaners. AVOID: teflon, “fluoro” or “perfluoro” ingredients.\n6.      Glycol ethers—solvents derived from fuel, found in cleaning solutions and personal care products, as well as paints, inks, and degreasers. The European Union says that some of these chemicals “may damage fertility or the unborn child.” Children who were exposed to glycol ethers from paint in their bedrooms had substantially more asthma and allergies. AVOID: In personal care products—propylene glycol, ethanol, and other glycols. In cleaning products—2-butoxyethanol and methoxydiglycol.\nYes, the best solution is better regulation to keep harmful chemicals from coming to the market, while removing those already there that we know or suspect to be harmful. However, having been to lobby Congress twice now for the Safe Cosmetics and Personal Care Act, and having heard firsthand the political roadblocks that arise out of party affiliations and self-serving turf battles on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I have reservations that the committee will ever even allow this critical health preventative measure to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote. But as American purchasers, we have the power to decide to never purchase the products that contain these chemicals that in turn support the companies that lobby against change.\nPlease read your product labels, pull aside any with these ingredients, and find a safer alternative. Sadly, many of the most dangerous chemicals will not even be on the label because manufacturers have lobbied the government to exempt them from this requirement, and they can omit any ingredient that is considered part of a secret formula.\nYes, it does take a bit of time, but knowing how harmful these chemicals are to the basic and necessary functions of your body, isn’t it worth the effort?  If you use conventional products, they contain these ingredients. This does affect you.\nMake 2014 the year you take the steps to reduce your “body burden” of chemicals that you inhale, ingest, and absorb that are suspected or known to cause harm.\nWe are here to help.\nAva.\nAt the age of 15, Ava Anderson launched her own line of personal care and home-cleaning products, Ava Anderson Non-Toxic.

We know that BPA affects our hormones, and it's been linked – although not conclusively – with all sorts of hormone-related health problems including asthma, obesity, diabetes, ADHD, breast and prostate cancers, and reproductive abnormalities.\nBecause of its hormonal action, BPA is classified as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC). But it's not the only EDC you'll find in everyday items like cosmetics, food containers and even flooring. \nHow EDCs affect us\nThe endocrine system is a series of ductless glands that secrete hormones directly into the blood to regulate various body functions. The glands include:\n\ngonads – produces sex hormones (oestrogen and testosterone)\nthyroid – produces thyroid hormone\nadrenal – produce adrenaline\npancreas – produces insulin\npituitary – produces growth hormone\n\nBody fat, muscle, heart, liver, intestines and kidneys have secondary endocrine functions and also produce hormones.\nMany substances affect our endocrine systems. When ingested, absorbed or inhaled into the body, these substances interfere with the production, action and/or elimination of our naturally present hormones.\nWhich EDCs should we be worried about?\nBPA may be one of the highest-profile endocrine disruptors, but we're regularly exposed to plenty of others.\nOther known EDCs include:\n\nsynthetic chemicals used as industrial solvents/lubricants and their byproducts (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), dioxins)\nplasticisers (phthalates)\npesticides (methoxychlor, chlorpyrifos, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and tributyltin)\nfungicides (vinclozolin)\npharmaceutical agents (diethylstilbestrol)\n\nAlthough rarely called endocrine disruptors, natural substances such as soy and beta-sitosterol also have hormonal effects, while pharmaceuticals including hormone replacement therapy and the oral contraceptive pill have endocrine-disrupting effects.\nAnother concern is that of an estimated 50,000 chemicals in use today, very few have been tested for endocrine effects. Even of the 800 or so chemicals suspected to be endocrine disruptors, only a small proportion of these have been tested.\nEndocrine disorders on the rise\nEndocrine disorders are on the rise worldwide and include:\n\nlow semen quality and fertility in young men\ngenital malformations, such as non-descending testes (cryptorchidisms) and penile malformations (hypospadias) in baby boys\npremature birth and low birth weight\nneurobehavioural disorders associated with thyroid disruption in children (autism, attention deficit disorders and learning disabilities)\nendocrine-related cancers (breast, endometrial, ovarian, prostate, testicular and thyroid)\nearlier onset of breast development in young girls, which is a risk factor for breast cancer, obesity and type-2 diabetes.\n\nStudies have confirmed EDCs as the cause of many, although not all, of these disorders - and in some cases can account for their increase. Endocrine disorders have also been observed in wild and domestic animals.\n\nWho is most vulnerable to the effects of EDCs?\nOur age and developmental stage plays a critical role in how, or even if, endocrine disruptors have an effect. Humans and other animals are most vulnerable to EDCs during critical periods of development, such as during foetal development and puberty. And there can be a long time between exposure to an endocrine disruptor and when the effects are manifested, and these can span several generations – so, a pregnant woman's exposure may ultimately affect her grandchildren.\nAcknowledging the vulnerability of the developing foetus and infant, the Danish government has compiled an English-version consumer brochure for pregnant women explaining how they can avoid exposure to known and suspected endocrine disruptors while pregnant and breastfeeding, and for their baby after birth (information which could be useful for any consumer wishing to avoid them).\nWhat do lab tests reveal?\nThere's a lot we don't know about the effects of EDCs. There are many obstacles facing researchers trying to establish whether a substance is an endocrine disruptor and under what circumstances.\nAnimal testing\nAlthough a lot information about endocrine disruption has come from lab animals, animal testing doesn't always correlate well from one species to another. For example, rats are more sensitive to some chemicals than other animals (including humans), yet less sensitive to others. Even within a species some breeds are more sensitive than others.\nDosage\nMany endocrine disruptors have different effects at different doses. The problem arises when scientists only study very large doses, and if proven safe they assume it's still safe at lower doses.\nHowever, there's increasing evidence that very low doses of certain chemicals have an equally or more potent effect as high doses. The effect may be the same as the high dose, where an intermediate dose shows no effect. Or the effect may be different but equally problematic. For example, pregnant mice given large doses of an oestrogenic drug called diethylstilbestrol have extremely skinny offspring, while very low doses produce obese offspring. Alternatively, some endocrine disruptors may have an effect at medium doses, but have none at very high or very low doses.\nPotential interactions\nTesting also often overlooks the combined effects of more than one EDC – they may magnify, alter or cancel out any endocrine effects they have individually. This applies to products such as cosmetics or pesticides, which contain a raft of chemicals that could alter the effects of EDCs. Studies on herbicides containing glyphosate, for example, found that the formulation of the product in which it was contained was the major determinant of endocrine effects, rather than the concentration of glyphosate.\nTest conditions vs normal use\nFinally, just because a product contains known EDCs, they may not actually be in a form that causes a problem. The Danish environmental protection agency tested various products containing EDCs, including mobile phone covers, work gloves, sleeping mats, sneakers and handbags, and found the chemicals didn't migrate from the products under simulated conditions of normal use. On the other hand, for decades it was assumed that BPA wouldn't cause problems because it was safely locked up in polycarbonate plastic – but when heated or washed in harsh detergents, it was released.\nThe precautionary approach vs wait-and-see\nSome jurisdictions adopt the precautionary approach when it comes to regulating known or suspected endocrine disruptors: this means banning EDCs from certain or all applications.\nRelevant Australian authorities, including the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), the Australian Pesticides \u0026 Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA), the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS) and the various state and local environmental and water authorities are taking a wait-and-see approach, until there are more definitive research results.\nEDCs in consumer products\nBisphenol A (BPA)\n\nFound in:\n\npolycarbonate plastics, including food and beverage containers\nlinings of tins and jar lids\n\nThe oestrogenic properties of BPA were identified in the 1930s when researchers were looking to treat symptoms relating to menopause, menstruation, nausea in pregnancy and prevention of miscarriages. It wasn't pursued for this use, but rather for its plasticising properties – by the 1950s BPA was used in epoxy resins for protective coatings, linings and adhesives, then later for making clear, hard polycarbonate plastic.\nBPA's endocrine-disrupting properties arose as an issue for research scientists in the 1990s, where its presence in water bottles and polycarbonate animal cages, as well as polycarbonate laboratory equipment, was producing unexpected experimental effects.\nHaving established that the BPA in polycarbonate was the source of contamination, the observed oestrogenic effects were not surprising. But the fact it was leaching out of plastic in quantities that could cause significant effects was unexpected, and given its ubiquity in a variety of consumer goods, the implications were enormous.\nStudies on animals and in vitro testing on human cells have linked BPA exposure with breast and prostate cancers, obesity, neurobehavioural problems and reproductive abnormalities. Because babies and young children are more vulnerable to its effects due to their development stage and rates of metabolism, products for this group have caused the most concern. BPA is more likely to leach from containers into food and beverages if the containers are heated or the contents are acidic, while harsh detergents can break down the plastics causing BPA to be released.\nBPA has been banned or voluntarily withdrawn from use in baby bottles in Australia, Canada, the US, Turkey and some European and Asian countries, and banned for use in linings of jars and tins for food aimed at children under three in France and Sweden. An American BPA producer famously required customers to agree it wouldn't be used in products aimed at children under three.\nWhat you can do: While it's difficult to know whether BPA is in tin or jar linings, you can avoid polycarbonate plastics used in water bottles and other food containers (a number \"7\" in the recycling triangle means the plastic is polycarbonate or \"other\", and a sign it may contain BPA).\n\nUV filters\n\nFound in:\n\nsunscreen\ncosmetics with sun protection, e.g. lip balm, make-up and moisturiser\n\nSome chemical sunscreens, including widely used octyl methoxycinnamate (also called OMC or ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate), as well as 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC) and benzophenone 3, have been found in some studies to have developmental and reproductive effects, as well as thyroid effects from OMC. Most studies look at the chemicals in isolation, whereas in reality there is often more than one chemical sunscreen used in a preparation, not to mention other potential endocrine disruptors, such as parabens. The combined effects of these aren't known.\nWhat you can do: Choose sunscreens with physical blockers, such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.\n\nPhthalates\n\nFound in:\n\nflooring\nfood wrap\ncosmetics such as fragrances, lotions and nail polish\npharmaceuticals\n\nPhthalates are common chemicals primarily used as plasticisers in manufacturing flexible vinyl plastic found in flooring, food wrap and medical devices. They are also found in cosmetics and personal-care products, such as fragrances, lotions and nail polish, and pharmaceuticals where they're used in coatings for timed-release pills. As such, we eat, breathe and absorb them through our skin. They have been linked with endometriosis and early puberty in girls, and reproductive organ abnormalities and reduced fertility in males. They can also act on the thyroid, and have been linked with obesity.\nWhat you can do: Some of the dangerous phthalates have been banned in cosmetics and children's toys in Europe, and toys in the US. Only one phthalate has been banned in Australian toys. As they're often found in fragrances such as air fresheners, you can avoid perfumed personal care and household products.\n\nParabens\n\nFound in:\n\n\ncosmetic and personal care products.\n\nParabens are preservatives used in many cosmetic and personal care products and have been found to have oestrogenic effects. The larger the molecule, the greater the effect, with the smaller molecule parabens being the safest, including methyl paraben which is the most commonly used. The European Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety conducted a review of parabens in consumer goods, and determined that they didn't pose a risk in the quantities permitted in such products. However the Danish government has banned the use of some of the larger-molecule parabens (propyl-, isopropyl-, butyl- and isobutyl-parabens) in products for children up to three years old as a precautionary measure, as children might be especially vulnerable to endocrine effects. This is of particular concern if products are used on broken skin, such as nappy rash.\nWhat you can do: Check the ingredients list for propyl-, isopropyl-, butyl- and isobutyl-parabens.\n\nPesticides and herbicides\nMany pesticides are endocrine disruptors, including some that have been banned but persist in the environment, and those that have been banned in some countries but not Australia, and some still widely in use including DDT, endosulfan, synthetic pyrethroids and chlorpyrifos.\nDDT has an oestrogenic effect, and although it has been banned in most countries for several decades, it persists in the environment and the food chain. It's still used in some countries for mosquito control where observable short-term malaria deaths are a greater concern than potential longer-term endocrine effects.\nAtrazine is a selective herbicide used on animal feed crops, sugar cane and forestry plantations, and canola crops. Apart from food residues, it can also enter the water supply, and has been linked with neuroendocrine effects. The Australian regulatory authorities determined that it doesn't pose a risk, but will continue to monitor research.\nGlyphosate (the active ingredient in Roundup weed killer) is widely used throughout the world in agriculture, parks and home gardens, and has been linked with endocrine-disruption effects related to growth, sexual development and reproduction. Various food crops (soy, canola, corn, cotton, sugar beet) have been genetically modified so they're resistant to glyphosate.\nWhat you can do: Wash all fruit and vegetables before eating them. Where possible avoid buying imported fresh, canned or frozen produce from countries with dubious pesticide regulation. Buy GM-free to avoid plant foods (such as canola and soy) that are tolerant to pesticides.\n\nTriclosan\nFound in:\n\nantibacterial soap and hand wash\ntoothpaste\ncleaning cloths\ncutting boards\n\nTriclosan is an antibacterial compound found in soap, hand wash and toothpaste, as well as other consumer products such as cleaning cloths and cutting boards. It interferes with the thyroid hormone and is oestrogenic. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently reviewing the safety of triclosan, pointing out that while it's \"not currently known to be hazardous to humans\", tests on mammals and other animals have shown hormonal effects that warrant further scientific and regulatory review. There are also concerns that it may contribute to antibiotic resistance. The FDA also points out that there's no evidence that it has any extra health benefits over soap and water. According to the precautionary principle, it may be better to avoid it.\nWhat you can do: Use soap and water. Many \"antibacterial\" soaps and toothpastes in the supermarket contain triclosan (liquid soaps and toothpaste) and triclocarban (bar soaps), so check the label.\n\nResorcinol\nFound in:\n\nhair dyes\ntopical treatments for acne, seborrhoeic dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, corns and warts\n\nResorcinol is used as an antiseptic and disinfectant. Resorcinol is currently on the European Union's Category 1 list of endocrine disruptors, and has been linked to thyroid disease when used in large quantities on broken skin over a long period of time.\nWhat you can do: Look for hair dye that's resorcinol-free, and don't overuse products containing resorcinol on broken skin.\n\nPerfluoroalkyl acids (PFOA)\nFound in:\n\nfurniture upholstery, carpets, weatherproof clothing (e.g. Gore-Tex)\ncoatings for non-stick cookware (Teflon)\nfast-food paper wrappers/containers\n\nTheir resistance to solvents, acids and bases as well as their non-stick quality and heat resistance makes these chemicals highly useful in a variety of consumer products, including stain- and water-repellent coatings and treatments for textiles (such as furniture upholstery, carpets, weatherproof clothing – think Gore-Tex), coatings for non-stick cookware (Teflon) and paper fast-food wrappers/containers.\nComponents of the polymers, in particular PFOA, have been linked with thyroid disease. While the WHO/UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has listed PFOA as a potential obesogen (a substance which may lead to obesity), a panel of expert scientists established to look into the effects of PFOA on people working in and living near a production factory determined that although it is probably associated with increased blood cholesterol, there was no evidence of a link with obesity or metabolic syndrome.\nWhat you can do: Look for PFOA-free, rather than Teflon, non-stick cookware. If you have Teflon cookware at home, use it at low temperatures, and if it's peeling throw it away – you don't want little bits in your food.\nMore information\n\nThe Endocrine Society is an international organisation of professionals concerned with endocrinology research and clinical practice. Its members include clinicians, researchers, educators, industry professionals and health professionals. They have provided a comprehensive review of the science behind endocrine disruptors.\nThe WHO and United Nations Environment Programme's report on EDCs was released in February 2013.\nThe Danish Ministry of the Environment has information and a consumer-friendly pamphlet (in English) for pregnant women on how to avoid EDCs.\n\n","Followers":"","title_name":"Concerned about chemicals?","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Karina Bray Senior Content Producer  Health","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"https://www.choice.com.au/authors/karina-bray","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"https://www.choice.com.au/health-and-body/beauty-and-personal-care/skin-care-and-cosmetics/articles/endocrine-disrupting-chemicals","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"28th July 2014","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5768366e94c25d5de00c7342"},"tag_v1":["Endocrine disruptors","Parabens","Phthalates"],"Pinterest":"","authors_point_of_view":"","Comments":"","article_data":"\nPaul Whaley posted this eye-opening news at the Health \u0026 Environment blog:\nParabens: endocrine disruptors in cosmetics and food?.\n“Parabens … are widely used as preservatives in cosmetics…  and have appeared in the news because of concern about their endocrine-disrupting potential, in particular their ability to mimic oestrogen…”\n“However, people may be less aware of the use of parabens in foodstuffs, identifiable on labelling as additives E214-219. The most commonly-used parabens in food are methylparaben (food additive E218) and ethylparaben (E214)…”\nI had no idea! And I’ve looked into a lot of contamination issues with foods! These are chemicals we wouldn’t normally think we are ingesting orally. Pesticides we now know about, some of us knew about phthalates, but parabens too?\nOk, it turns out some folks already knew, but only so far as those that are listed on labels, (and I haven’t bought much food requiring a label in years) but this new research shows them also appearing in foods that do not require ingredient labels! And these weren’t just the naturally occurring parabens, (as there are some, it turns out) but  synthetic parabens were also found!\nphthalates and parabens are found in almost all supermarket foods that were tested\nI recently wrote about other research that confirmed how commonly phthalates are found in supermarket foods, contamination from fragrance and plastic, but it seems we have more reasons to be careful about the foods and drinks we choose:\nFrom the Abstract: “Parabens are esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid and are widely used as preservatives in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, including beverages”\n\nYUCK!\n“In spite of wide use, information on the occurrence of parabens in foodstuffs and dietary exposure of humans to these chemicals is not generally available, possibly due to the historical assumption (prior to concerns emerging about endocrine disruption) that these compounds exhibit low toxicity and are therefore of low priority for research as potential environmental toxicants.\nAs a result, the first study reporting the occurrence of parabens in foodstuffs was only published this year, based on samples of foodstuffs bought in the US (Liao et al. 2013). In this study, 267 US food samples comprising of drinks, dairy products, fats and oils, fish and shellfish, grains, meat, fruits, and vegetables were analysed for five parabens: methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, butyl- and benzylparaben.”\nOver 90% of the food samples contained measurable concentrations of parabens.\n“There were no significant differences in paraben concentrations among the eight food categories, including the canned foods.”\nComplete article with more details about the different types of parabens: http://healthandenvironmentonline.com/2013/06/17/parabens-endocrine-disruptors-in-cosmetics-and-food/\n♦\nDoing a little more searching, it seems foods in China are also affected, in case anyone thought that might be a viable alternative (as if):\n “Despite their widespread use, prior to this study, paraben concentrations in foodstuffs from China and human dietary exposure to these chemicals have been unknown. In this study, concentrations of six parabens were determined in 13 categories of food samples (n=282), including cereals and cereal products, meat, fish and seafood, eggs, dairy products, bean products, fruits, vegetables, cookies, beverages, cooking oils, condiments, and others, collected from nine cities in China. \n“Almost all (detection rate: 99%) food samples contained at least one of the parabens analyzed”  \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23685225\n♦\nDoes sewage sludge have a role?\nOne of the commenters at the Health \u0026 Environment blog suggested that the use of sewage sludge on farmers fields may be a possible source for some of the synthetic parabens getting into foods. That research might not have been done yet, but there’s a growing body of research about other chemicals found in sludge:\nPaul Whaley provided this link to research, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22sewage+sludge%22+toxicology  and I used another term for this search (there is some overlap in the results): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22sewage+sludge%22+chemicals\n♦\nHere is a recent article that reports about a study that “involved residents from Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina who live near fields where sludge is applied as a soil amendment. More than half of the people interviewed reported acute symptoms such as burning eyes, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after sludge had been sprayed or spread.”\nhttp://www.motherearthnews.com/natural-health/municipal-sewage-sludge-zwfz1303zhun.aspx\n♦\nAnd then there’s this from 2002:\n“Researchers found that affected residents lived within approximately one kilometer (0.6 miles) of land application sites and generally complained of irritation after exposure to winds blowing from treated fields. A prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus infections, a condition commonly accompanying diaper rash, was found in the skin and respiratory tracts of some individuals. …\n\nThe NAS report entitled “Biosolids Applied to Land: Advancing Standards and Practices” cites growing allegations that exposure to Class B sludge, the most common form, is causing illnesses and sporadic deaths among residents. The report concludes that certain types of exposure, such as inhalation of sludge particles, “were not adequately evaluated” previously and no work has been done on risks from mixtures of pathogens and chemicals found in sludge.

Thanks to pesticides, human and veterinary drugs, plastics, cleaning agents, cosmetics, antibiotics, and sunscreen—all products that have been intentionally introduced into waterways—our once pristine aquatic habitats are contaminated, and male frogs can’t reproduce. \nThese products have not only fouled our natural water systems and chemically castrated frogs; they are also eroding your health. \nPhthalates Are Toxic\nA recent study tracked 501 couples as they tried to conceive. One finding stood out: men were more likely to be the cause of infertility then women. \nThe problem was tracked to phthalates—chemicals that make plastics softer and more flexible. Apparently, phthalates interfere with testosterone, and are associated with a variety of hormone-related conditions:\n\nInterfere with male reproductive organ development\nCause genital defects\nLower testosterone levels in adolescent males\nLower sperm count in adult males\n\nPhthalates (pronounced f-THAL-lates) are used in cosmetics and plastics, but also in packaging, textiles, detergents and other household products. They are found in the tubing used in hospitals to deliver medications, enteric coatings used to create time-release capsules, and countless other products including skincare products. \nTypes of Phthalates\n\nDBP (di-n-butyl phthalate)\nDEP (diethyl phthalate)\nDEHP (di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate or bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate)\nBzBP (benzylbutyl phthalate)\nDMP (dimethyl phthalate)\n\nYoung children are particularly at high risk. In 2008, the government banned phthalates in children’s toys. These chemicals cross the placental barrier, putting fetal development at risk to toxicity from phthalates and other endocrine disrupting chemicals. \nAbout a billion pounds of phthalates are produced every year, and their use is so widespread that they are nearly impossible to avoid entirely. In random testing, researchers found that 95 percent of Americans have detectable levels of phthalates in urine. But, phthalates are just one of many chemicals the mess with hormones. \nWhat Are Endocrine Disruptors?\nHormones are chemical messengers produced in specialized glands. They can travel everywhere in the body, where they coordinate complex processes like growth, metabolism, fertility, and immunity. Hormone-producing glands and the hormones they secrete make up the endocrine system. \nEndocrine disruptors are chemicals that interfere with the body’s endocrine system. They produce adverse developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effects in both humans and wildlife. \nEven in very small amounts, these chemicals cause big problems. They can increase the production of certain hormones and decrease the production of others, imitate hormones, turn one hormone into another, interfere with hormone signaling, trigger cells to die prematurely, compete with essential nutrients, bind to essential hormones making them inactive, and accumulate in organs that produce hormones—rendering their function abnormal. The results of endocrine disruption include birth defects, infertility, diabetes, liver toxicity, and cancer. \nThe endocrine system is one of the body’s most important internal communication systems. It is how cells talk to each other to keep everything working right. Hormones are the primary messengers of the endocrine system, traveling back and forth among cells carrying instructions for life. Disrupting normal endocrine function, results in serious, and often permanent, consequences on our health, as well as that of future generations.\nIn the body, hormones occur in extremely low levels. For example, hormones like estradiol and testosterone are measured in micrograms (mcg), nanograms (ng), or pictograms (pg) per milliter (mL) or deciliter (dL). In such small amounts, it doesn’t take much to disrupt hormone balance. \nThe “Dirty Dozen” of Endocrine Disruptors\n\nBPA (Bisphenol A)\nDioxin\nAtrazine\nPhthalates\nPerchlorate\nFire Retardants\nLead\nArsenic\nMercury\nPFCs (Perflorinated chemicals)\nOrganophosphate Pesticides\nGlycol Esters\n\nThese chemicals are unsafe in any amount. The environment, our shared natural commons, is awash with endocrine disruptors. And so is your kitchen. \nThe End of Tupperware\nTupperware plastic containers were invented in 1948, and shortly afterwards sales exploded because of women selling directly to each other at Tupperware parties. Tupperware claims that all their products are BPA-free, but are not specific about phthalates. Consumer protection groups are wary. \nSimilar plastic food preparation and storage containers are now sold everywhere. Some manufacturers label products as “BPA-free.” But, can any plastic be completely free of BPA and phthalates? I find it too much work to investigate every plastic container, so avoid all plastics as much as possible. \nResearchers found that most plastic products leach endocrine-disrupting chemicals even if they’re labeled “BPA-free!” They also found that 70 percent of common plastic products tested positive for estrogenic activity. BPAs are associated with disrupting estrogen and have been implicated in breast cancer. The main source of exposure to BPA is through diet. \nBPA (Bisphenol A) leaches into food from the protective internal epoxy resin coatings used in canned foods, polycarbonate tableware, plastic food storage containers, water bottles, and baby bottles. How much BPA leaches from these products into food and water depend on the temperature of the liquid or bottle, as when heated in a microwave oven. BPA is also found in breast milk.\nFrom NIH Institute of Environmental Health Sciences\n\nWhat You Can Do To Avoid Endocrine Disruptors\nPlastics are everywhere in the environment. Even if you threw out all plastics in your house today, you’d likely still have residual amounts in your body. \nDoctors can easily test for heavy metals like arsenic and mercury, but there are no simple, inexpensive laboratory tests for phthalates and BPAs. A few innovate labs, like Metametrix, offer urine testing for phthalates, but most doctors are not familiar with this kind of testing and insurance companies are not likely to reimburse. \nEven if people are more cautious about exposure to phthalates and BPAs, animals will continue to suffer from the accumulation of these toxic chemicals in the water system. It seems we could be on the brink of the extinction of numerous species of amphibians and reptiles. These animals are like the canaries in cold mines, and when they are gone, so too will be our early warning system. \nI am also concerned about the role endocrine disruptors play in autoimmune diseases and chronic fatigue syndrome, as well as in the rising incidence of hypo- and hyper-thyroid conditions. My clinical hunch is that in genetically susceptible individuals, they play a significant role as disease-causing agent. Even miniscule amounts of BPA have shown to impair breast development and trigger abnormal cell growth associated with breast cancer. \nUntil we have convenient, affordable, and reliable testing, take control of your home and personal environment. Avoid phthalates and other endocrine disruptors by making dramatic changes in your shopping choices and how you store food. \nDo These Five Things Now\n\nReplace plastic food storage containers with glass. \nDon’t microwave in plastic or Styrofoam containers.\nDon’t allow your children to suck or chew on plastic or vinyl toys.\nDon’t drink water from plastic bottles or plastic cups. \nUse only personal care products labeled “phthalate-free.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nJ.

Our awareness of breast cancer has come a long way since a pharmaceutical company started Breast Cancer Awareness Month back in 1985, but the fact remains that despite the billions of dollars that have been spent on the cause, we’re apparently no closer to the cure than we were before. It’s as if we’re more aware of “breast cancer awareness” than the disease itself.\nMost of the research for “the cure” still focuses on the same treatments that are not curing cancer; i.e., chemo, drugs, and radiation. The fact remains that the number of deaths per year from breast cancer has remained around 40,000 for the past two decades, and according to breastcancer.org, one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. Awareness doesn’t seem to be changing the numbers.\n\n\nFree Lavera Lipgloss Offer\nIn honor of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we are giving away a free Lavera Rosy Promise Lipgloss! Any order $50US or more (after discounts, excluding shipping and taxes) will have this item automatically added at no charge.\n\nSome of the money raised goes into promoting mammograms in an effort to find cancer early enough before it has spread. Unfortunately, 90-96% of women who now have metastatic breast cancer were indeed diagnosed at an early stage, so that doesn’t seem to be working either (as important as mammograms are). I can’t help but wonder where we’d be today if all the money that has gone into awareness and marketing went into figuring out what causes breast cancer in the first place and how we can prevent it.\nThe cure is in the cause. The cause will give you the cure.\n- Charlotte Gerson, Founder of the Gerson Institute\n\nToday, in 2015, there are still more questions than answers regarding breast cancer. We’re told about risk factors like late menopause, having children late in life, and family history of cancer, yet 70% of those with breast cancer have none of these known “risk factors.” I’m part of the 30%. I had never smoked, wasn’t overweight, exercised regularly, and had been eating mainly organic foods for years. I never missed a yearly mammogram; in fact, I had an all-clear mammogram two weeks prior to feeling a lump in my breast. This lump which was missed in my mammogram turned out to be a 2.5 cm triple negative (meaning very aggressive) cancerous tumor. Twelve years later, I remain passionate about finding the cause and cure. As an esthetician, I study the skin, so that is my focus here. Many of you know that the skin is our largest and most permeable organ. Just about anything we put on our skin will end up in our bloodstream and be distributed throughout our bodies. Because we lack the necessary enzymes to break down many of these chemicals, they tend to accumulate over time, such as with lead in hair dyes and mercury in skin whiteners. Girls often start using cosmetics at a very young age which increases their lifetime exposure. Many chemicals are considered safe in low doses by themselves. The concern is the damage they can cause when used over time and synergistically with each other. There’s no research or data on this.Considering that women are exposed to 168 unique chemicals in cosmetics and skincare products every day, and men are exposed to 85, I think that more awareness regarding ingredient safety is called for. While discussing this with my former oncologist years ago, he said what I’ve heard many people say: “Do you really think that products with carcinogenic ingredients would be allowed on the market?!”\nI know that the European Union (EU) wouldn’t allow them. To date, the EU has banned nearly 1,400 chemicals in cosmetics; our Food and Drug Administration has banned only 11. You can imagine how bad those 11 are, yet they were in your hair and skin care products as recently as in the1970s. It makes me wonder what people will be saying in 2055 about the ingredients that are “acceptable” today. For example, here are seven common skin-care ingredients that are used in the U.S. but banned in other nations:\n1. Formaldehyde: This chemical is used as a preservative and also includes a group of substances known as “formaldehyde donors,” which effectively release formaldehyde into a product. One of the most controversial of these donors is quaternium-15, which until recently was found in baby shampoos. The American Academy of Dermatology warns that formaldehyde can cause severe allergic reactions. Canada has banned it in personal care products.\n2. Benzidine: This chemical can be found in many hair dyes. Although it can no longer be produced in the US, it can be imported. It is a known carcinogen.\n3. Petroleum: It is often found in mascaras sold in the United States. Petroleum distillates are used as emollients and are also found in eye shadow, lotions, creams, hairspray, and foundation makeup. Petroleum has been linked to cancer and has been banned in the European Union.\n4. Hydroquinone: This is used to lighten hyperpigmentation (dark spots on the skin generally caused by sun damage). It has also been linked to lung irritation and tumors in mice. Canada and some Asian and African countries have banned the use of hydroquinone in skin products.\n5. BHA: Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) is used as a preservative in moisturizers, shaving creams, fragrances, and makeup, particularly lipsticks. It is linked to endocrine disruption and cancer, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The EU prohibits its use in fragrances, and California requires a warning label on all products that contain BHA. On top of the human danger, it adversely affects the environment because it accumulates in water and kills wildlife.\n6. Parabens: These chemicals are used as preservatives in a variety of cosmetics. They are suspected endocrine disruptors and may interfere with male reproductive function. They’re commonly used in deodorants and antiperspirants and have also been linked to breast cancer. The EU banned parabens in 2012.\n7. Lead: Although lead is never listed in lipsticks as an ingredient, it can be found in many of them. Lead is a neurotoxin and can be dangerous even at small doses, but the FDA doesn’t consider the lead levels in lipsticks to be a safety concern since it’s ingested in very small quantities.\nAccording to the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, more than one in five personal care products contain chemicals linked to cancer. Eighty percent contain ingredients with hazardous impurities, and 56 percent contain “penetration enhancers” that help deliver ingredients deeper into the skin. Eighty-nine percent of the ingredients used in personal care products have not been evaluated for safety by the FDA or any other publicly accountable institution.\nIn the United States, both cosmetics and drugs are regulated by the FDA. For drugs, the FDA requires that new products be shown to be safe and effective before they are allowed to be sold. This is not the case for cosmetics. Although the FDA requires that cosmetics be safe, it does not have the authority to require companies to test their cosmetic products (except some color additives) before they are put on the market. The FDA holds cosmetic firms themselves responsible for confirming the safety of their products and ingredients prior to marketing.\nSo who does test for unsafe additives in beauty products in the U.S.? The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR), a self-policing safety panel, is the FDA’s main source of scientific data. According to its Website, the CIR “thoroughly reviews and assesses the safety of ingredients used in cosmetics in an open, unbiased, and expert manner, and publishes the results in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.” It’s interesting to note that the CIR is funded by the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), an industry group of more than 600 cosmetic companies. In fact, the PCPC reportedly spent over $600,000 on lobbyists in Sacramento to prevent the California Safe Cosmetics Act of 2005 from passing, a law that would have required manufacturers to post any unsafe ingredients on product labels.\nReports from environmental and public-health groups, like the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, have often directly contradicted the “safe” findings of the CIR. In a 2007 study, the Environmental Working Group found that that 1 in 30 products sold in the U.S. fails to meet industry or government safety standards. Nearly 400 products sold in the U.S. contain chemicals banned in Japan, Canada, and the EU.\nMost testing of cosmetics (and their ingredients) look for short-term issues such as skin or eye irritation or allergic reactions. Short-term health issues are likely to become apparent once a product reaches the market and is used widely. It is much more difficult, however, to identify long-term toxic or carcinogenic (cancer-causing) effects.\nEven labels are misleading because not all ingredients need to be disclosed. Many ingredients are hidden behind the word “fragrance” as well. Because fragrance is considered a trade secret, many manufacturers get around leaving off ingredients that are suspect in this way. They fall under the umbrella of “fragrance.”\nTo complicate matters even more, the word “fragrance” often means something entirely different when it’s concerning a product made in the EU vs. one made here in the U.S. The Environmental Working Group (EWG), a popular site for researching ingredients and skin care products, defines fragrance as “an undisclosed mixture of various scent chemicals and ingredients used as fragrance dispersants such as diethyl phthalate. Fragrance mixes have been associated with allergies, dermatitis, respiratory distress and potential effects on the reproductive system.” All of this can be true in regards to synthetic fragrance, but when the “fragrance” in question is a carefully researched blend of natural essential oils, this doesn’t apply.\nIs your head beginning to spin? Are you wondering who in the world you can trust to lead you to safe skin care products and cosmetics? Despite its flaws, the EWG and their Skin Deep database are a good resource for those wanting to learn more about skin-related health issues and ingredient concerns. They rank products and ingredients on a 0-10 scale in terms of safety. There are just several things you need to keep in mind when you use their database.\n• The information they have is taken from the ingredient labels given to them by the manufacturers. They are not doing any actual investigations themselves. Their rating is dependent upon the accuracy and transparency of any given manufacturer. As a result, their ratings also do not take into account the percentages of composition. This means a product with 0.1% parabens would have the same hazard as one with 10 times more parabens.\n• Keep in mind that many chemicals are harmful individually, but together they create a beneficial and safe product. Let’s take lye, for instance. Lye alone is unsafe, but after it reacts with oil and water to create soap, it’s harmless. In this same way, many essential oils have Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) warnings that could be misunderstood and deemed as dangerous when taken out of context. MSDS sheets were designed to inform the end user of how to handle the ingredients properly in their undiluted form; they weren’t meant for us to use in considering the safety of a cosmetic.\n• They do not discern between a naturally sourced ingredient or a synthetic variant. For example, when it comes to “fragrance,” both synthetic fragrances (phthalates and all!) and natural essential oils get the same scores of 9. Because of this, a Walgreens sunscreen lotion might be given an overall ranking of 3, while a Dr. Hauschka all-natural sunscreen might get an overall ranking of 7, all because of the “fragrance” from all an all natural essential oil with a ranking of 8. So, you can see that you have to dig a little deeper when it comes to “Skin Deep” ratings.\n• In a sense, they are systemically biased against European products. For example, in the EU, all components of an essential oil must be listed, but in the U.S. these components are not listed. Let’s take the essential oil rose, for example. For rose oil, the EU lists it like this: Rosa Canina Fruit Oil (or as part of Fragrance/Parfum), geraniol**, limenone**, linalool**, eugenol**, citronellol**\nIn the U.S., it’s listed like this:\nRose Essential Oil (or Fragrance)\nAlthough both oils are exactly the same, the EWG ranks every single component listed in the EU description separately and does not discern between 0.01% or 5% of an ingredient. So, while rose oil itself might get a ranking of 0 in the product from the U.S., it wouldn’t get that kind of ranking if every single component is ranked, and those individual components (taken out of context) might each get a 5+ ranking. If you’re still reading at this point, that tells me you’re really serious about the types of skincare products you use, and I applaud you for being an advocate for your health. During this month of awareness, my hope is that I’ve brought a little more awareness to the importance of the hair and skincare products you use. The good news is that so many safe, effective, and affordable products are available these days. On the True Natural website, you’ll find products that have been certified by leading organizations in the EU and found to be free from any harmful ingredients. This means that you will not find any products that contain formaldehyde, benzidine, petroleum, hydroquinone, BHA, parabens or lead, to name just a few, helping us all to Think Pink But Go Green! ","Followers":"","title_name":"Think Pink, But Go Green!","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Janet Kelly","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"Hover over the photograph of the editor to get her further knowledge","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.truenatural.com/blog/breast-cancer-awareness-2015/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"30-09-2015 19:08","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

This segment on US TV channel Fox lists some of the main offenders and includes an interview with the Environmental Working Group, which campaigns for safer cosmetics:\nDC News FOX 5 DC WTTG\nHere’s a rundown of 5 of the most toxic cosmetics ingredients mentioned in the video in a little more detail:\n1. Phthalates\nThese plasticising chemicals are commonly found in a range of cosmetics, from perfume and hairspray to nail polish, deodorant and body lotions, as well as plastic packaging and toys. Because phthalates mimic the body’s hormones, they can disrupt the functioning of the endocrine system.\nTranslation? They are believed to affect reproductive development in children and teenagers and have been linked to early menopause. Studies have also linked phthalates to asthma and obesity in children. In this post we wrote about a study that linked phthalate exposure to premature birth.\nContrary to rumour, phthalates are not carcinogenic, according to Product Safety Australia.\n2. Parabens\nAs we wrote in this post, parabens are the most widely used synthetic preservatives in cosmetics and skincare products. They are found in most of the nearly 25,000 cosmetics and personal care products in Skin Deep, the Environmental Working Group’s (EWG) cosmetics database.\nParabens are endocrine disruptors and have been found in the breast cancer tumours of women in various studies. Though there’s no scientific consensus that parabens cause breast cancer, it’s safer to choose a paraben-free deodorant and if possible, go paraben-free for all your cosmetics.\nIf you’re checking the label on a skincare or cosmetics product, look for these names: butylparaben, parabens, isobutylparaben, isopropylparaben, sodium methylparaben, sodium propylparaben, ethylparaben, methylparaben, propylparaben, benzylparaben.\n3. Formaldehyde\nFormaldehyde is a naturally occurring organic compound that nearly every living animal and plant produces at various levels through the living process. It is a preservative used in cosmetics to prevent bacterial contamination. You’ll find it in nail polish, hair gel, soaps, makeup, shampoos, deodorants and hair straightening products.\nAccording to Product Safety Australia, “Exposure to low levels of formaldehyde does not present a health concern; however, exposure to cosmetics containing excessive levels of formaldehyde is a safety concern, especially when used directly on people’s hair and skin.”\nThe adverse health effects associated with high levels of exposure to formaldehyde in cosmetic products includes sensory irritation, skin sensitisation, breathing difficulties, asthma and cancer.\nIt is also classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organisation International Agency for Research on Cancer.\nOther names for formaldehyde include Formalin; Morbicid Acid; Methylene Oxide; Methylaldehyde and Methylene Glycol.\n4. Lead\nTrace levels of lead have been found in numerous top lipstick brands, according to this Sydney Morning Herald article.\nAccording to the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, “An expanded FDA study has found lead in hundreds of lipsticks at levels up to 7.19 ppm. Five of the 10 most lead-contaminated brands in the FDA study are made by L’Oreal USA.”\nThe recent science indicates there is no safe level of lead exposure.\nLead is a a highly poisonous heavy metal. It is a neurotoxin which damages the nervous system. It also affects the cardiovascular system, kidneys and immune system and can cause miscarriage if ingested while pregnant.\nWe believe it’s best to avoid using cosmetics that contain lead, even in trace amounts.\n5. Triclosan\nTriclosan is an antibacterial agent known to cause immune system and endocrine system dysfunction. Most commonly found in dishwashing and laundry detergents, it’s also in antibacterial soaps, toothpaste, tooth whitening products, antiperspirants/deodorants, shaving cream and body lotion.\nTriclosan is added to these products to increase shelf life and make a product feel silky and smooth, or to give it colour. Again, we say avoid cosmetics that contain triclosan.\nAvoiding toxic cosmetics\nAs we wrote about in this post, 5 Facts You Need to Know About Skincare Labels, we always advocate reading the label before purchasing any cosmetic or skincare product. Ingredients with long, unpronounceable names accompanied by numbers are the ones to watch out for.\nProduct Safety Australia cautions against buying cosmetics over the internet, particularly if you cannot see the ingredients label/list and the supplier is not located in Australia. It says: “If you cannot access the safety related information from your supplier, then do not purchase the product.”\nAustralian businesses who supply over the internet must comply with Australian product safety standards and regulations.\nFor more information on cosmetic chemicals visit the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics website.\n \nPlease share...FacebookTwitterPinterestGoogleEmailPrint","Followers":"","title_name":"Toxic cosmetics: why you must avoid these 5 ingredients","ShareThis":"","comments":[{"date":"March 31, 2014 at 1:45 pm","text":"Way cool!

Want the complete story, plus a host of other cutting-edge articles to make your job easier? Login or sign up!\nSilicones are among the latest ingredients clients love to hate. From health concerns to worries about environmental safety, silicones have been hung with a black shroud since the early 1990s when breast implants were first connected to women’s health issues. Since that time, silicone technology has been expanded, making this family of chemicals among the most used in the modern world. Even so, this doesn’t mean silicones are safe. So here are some facts and a little basic chemistry to help clear up the mythology now being spun about silicones.\nMyth No. 1: “Silicone” is the name of an ingredient.\nSilicones are a family of chemicals known as a class. No ingredient on its own is named “silicone,” which means you should never see silicone in the ingredient list of a product. Chemical classes share common traits. In this case, silicones are a class of polymers—molecules made of one or more (poly) repeating units (mers), usually put together in a straight line like the vertebrae that form your spine. In the case of silicones, units are made of two basic elements linked together: silicon and oxygen. This is written chemically as SiO. When they’re linked together to form a silicone, the SiO polymer is the backbone onto which other molecules can be attached, allowing for a variety of applications, functions, textures and benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the enormous variety of compounds that can be developed from silicones, they are among the most used family of materials in the world. You’ll find them in pharmaceuticals; medical supplies and equipment; automotive; aviation; astronomy; foods; beverages; biotech; construction; appliances; plumbing; paints; textiles; and toys. From 2006–2008, more than 6,000 patents were granted in the United States for innovative, never-before-seen silicones for use in cosmetics.1 These new silicones make serums silkier; give lotions and skin a satin and flawless finish; make BB and CC creams possible; minimize pores and wrinkles; reduce or eliminate irritation from sunscreens; and act as launchpads from which key performance ingredients can penetrate the skin. All in all, silicones have added new dimensions to skin care that make products more effective and more fun to use.\nMyth No. 2: Silicones are harming the ozone layer.\nWant the rest of the story? Simply sign up. It’s easy. Plus, it only takes 1 minute and it’s free!\nChloroflurocarbons (CFCs) are the chemicals harming the ozone layer, not silicones. Chlorine gas disrupts ozone formation in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, which is often described as harming the ozone layer. Silicones do not contain chlorine, which means they can’t contribute to this disruption.\nMyth No. 3: Silicones in cosmetics cause rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, chronic fatigue and cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplied topically, as they are in skin care, silicones are too large to penetrate the skin, so they cannot cause or worsen these conditions. However, concerns about silicone safety did not come from their use in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals or even wound care, where there is no skin to act as a barrier. They arose from silicone gel-filled breast implants. In fact, these concerns underlay the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) 1992 decision to place a moratorium on silicone gel breast implants due to inadequate safety and effectiveness data from the implant manufacturers. Later that decade, the FDA again allowed silicone gel-filled breast implants, but only for reconstruction and revision patients. It wasn’t until 2006, after years of safety studies, that the FDA completely lifted the moratorium, and silicone gel-filled breast implants again became available for everyone.\nMyth No. 4: Silicones are not biodegradable.\nAlthough silicones aren’t biodegradable in the traditional sense, they do degrade in the environment, where they break down into water, silicic acid and carbon dioxide. The degradation trigger for low molecular-weight silicones, such as cyclopentasiloxane, is sunlight and oxygen, but heavier weight silicones aren’t susceptible to UV, oxidation or ozone for that matter. They adsorb to sludge in wastewater treatment plants, where they are incinerated, entombed in landfills, or spread on golf courses, woodlands and agricultural fields as fertilizer. When deposited over soil, mineral clays act as a catalyst to undo the silicone’s polymer backbone. This can take weeks to years if the soil remains wet, but if the soil dries, it can take only days. Testing of soil treated with high levels of silicones showed no soil microorganisms are harmed in this process nor is plant growth affected.2\nMyth No. 5: Silicones cause irritation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilicones don’t irritate the skin. They actually lower or eliminate irritation because they cause ingredients to spread evenly during application, which prevents pocketing and minimizes percentages of potentially irritating forms of cosmetic and drug ingredients. These include alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), salicylic acid, strong emulsifiers and surfactants, benzoyl peroxide and organic sunscreens, such as oxybenzone, avobenzone and octinoxate. Silicones are used safely on all forms of sensitive skin, including that resulting from acne, rosacea, eczema, psoriasis, post-surgery, burns, diaper rash and skin ulcers.\nMyth No. 6: Silicones are allergens.\nSilicones are too large to enter the skin, so they can’t trigger an allergic reaction because they can’t react with the immune system. In fact, they’re so biologically inert when in contact with the skin, silicones are now replacing latex, a common allergen in adhesives, gloves and a wide array of other items. Silicones are also used on open wounds because they shorten healing time and do not promote bacterial growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have clients who are convinced they are allergic to silicones, rather than avoid silicone-containing products, suggest an allergy test. Because silicones don’t cause skin allergies, a new world of care will open up to your clients when silicone allergy is disproven.\nMyth No. 7: Silicones aren’t natural.\nSilicone science starts with sand, also known as silica. Made of finely ground quartz rock, sand is composed of the two most abundant elements in and on the earth: oxygen and silicon. Together, they form roughly 25% of the Earth’s crust.1 Natural silicon-based materials have been part of human survival since the Stone Age: The stones that made up the key survival technologies from that era—including arrowheads, bowls and grinding stones—were formed from flint, granite, sandstone, volcanic rock or other silicon dioxide-based materials. Later, two other silicon dioxide technologies, glass and ceramics, improved mankind’s lot even more.\nMany people get confused when it comes to the different terms used to describe silicones, so here’s a guide.\n\nSilicon. Fourteenth on the periodic table, this is the second most abundant element on earth and the key element in silicone chemistry.\nSilica. Made of silicon dioxide, silica exists in a fairly pure state in sand, which is the key source material for silicone production. When listed as a cosmetic ingredient, silica represents silicon dioxide, not silicone.\nSilicone. See myth No. 1.\n\nMyth No. 8: Silicones contribute to smog.\nThe chemicals that contribute to smog are volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These include acetone, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, methacrylates and ethyl acetate, found in fragrances, as well as nail and hair products. Because silicones are inorganic, they can’t possibly be VOCs, so they can’t contribute to smog formation.\nMyth No. 9: Silicones make skin greasy.\nIf that’s the case, your client is using the wrong formula for her skin. Most silicones are invisible when they’re resting on the skin, and some actually absorb sebum and mattify the skin, visibly minimizing pores in the process.\nMyth No. 10: Silicones suffocate the skin.\nSilicones are breathable: They allow oxygen, nitrogen and water vapors to pass through them on the way to, or out of, the skin. However, most silicones do not allow water to penetrate, making them excellent at reducing transepidermal water loss (TEWL)—a leading cause of skin dryness and dehydration.\nMyth No. 11: Silicones clog pores and cause breakouts.\nBecause they are unaffected by oxidation, silicones are noncomedogenic, do not go rancid and, because they are not irritating, they are nonacnegenic. They’re also hostile to bacterial or other microbial growth. However, they can increase the penetration of some ingredients, which, when the product includes common irritants, such as fragrance or pore-cloggers like lipid-rich plant oils, may be the actual culprits behind breakouts and blackheads.\nMyth No. 12: Silicones bioaccumulate in humans and other animals.\nSilicones do not bioaccumulate because they are too large to pass through cell membranes—a key requirement for bioaccumulation. Tests on organisms that dwell in water, soil or sediment have shown no adverse effects at concentrations well above those found in the environment2, nor are silicones metabolized by humans, other animals or microorganisms.\nSilicones are:\n\nImpermeable to the skin’s barrier and cell membranes;\nBreatheable;\nNoncomedogenic;\nNonirritating;\nNonacnegenic;\nHypoallergenic;\nEnvironmentally degradable; and\nHostile to microbial growth.\n\nAnd that’s the bottom line on silicones in skin care.\nREFERENCES\n1.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5768366e94c25d5de00c734d"},"tag_v1":["Silicone"],"Pinterest":"","authors_point_of_view":"","Comments":"","article_data":"\nBy Diana Zuckerman, PhD; Elizabeth Nagelin-Anderson, MA; and Elizabeth Santoro, RN, MPH\nUpdated 2016\n \nLast year, almost 300,000 women and teenagers underwent surgery to have their breasts enlarged with silicone or saline implants1 and almost 100,000 breast cancer patients had reconstruction after mastectomy, often with implants. The popularity of breast augmentation has tripled since 1997, when there were just over 101,000 of these procedures.2\n\nMore than 38,000 implant removal procedures in 2015.3 Plastic Surgery Given these statistics, it is not surprising that in spite of the increasing number of women with breast implants, debate continues to swirl about their safety. Many women are justifiably confused by the conflicting information they hear. Here are the facts about what is known and not known about the risks of breast implants.\nAfter a brief history of breast implants in the U.S., we will answer the following questions:\n\nWhat are the known risks?\nWhat happens when breast implants break?\nDo breast implants make women sick?\nWhat are other concerns?\nWhat if I need to get my implants removed?\nAre there newer, safer implants?\n\nHistory of Implants in the US\nBreast implants made with silicone envelopes and filled with silicone gel or saline (salt water) were first sold in the United States in the 1960s, but sales were relatively slow until the 1980s. By 1990, however, almost one million women had undergone breast implant surgery, even though no safety studies had been published. Most of those women had silicone gel breast implants, which the plastic surgeons preferred.\nAlthough most medical products must be proven safe and effective before they can be sold in the U.S., that was not true for implanted medical devices sold before 1976.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not require that companies selling silicone breast implants prove that their implants were safe until 1991 – after they had been in use for almost three decades. For the first time, the media started to report about women with implant problems, and quoted doctors who were concerned about implant safety. When the studies were provided to the FDA, the safety data were found to be inadequate to warrant FDA approval.\nThe FDA did not require implant makers to prove that their saline implants were safe until 2000, when, despite high complication rates, the FDA approved saline breast implants for the first time.\nSilicone gel breast implants were approved for the first time in November 2006. Between 1992 and 2006, silicone implants were restricted to clinical trials that were primarily for cancer patients and women with broken implants. Patients were required to be informed that the implants were not approved by the FDA and to be regularly evaluated by their plastic surgeons as part of the study, in order to provide safety data intended to help all women with gel implants. Although silicone gel breast implants made by two manufacturers were approved in November 2006, there are still restrictions. For example, they are only approved for women over the age of 22, because younger women are still developing physically and emotionally and probably would not fully understand the risks.\nWhat are the known risks?\nReports of complications among women with implants have been published in medical journals and discussed at public FDA meetings. There are a number of short-term and long-term risks that any woman thinking about getting breast implants or about removing or replacing older implants needs to be aware of.\n“Local complications” refer to problems that occur in the breast area that are obviously related to the breast implants or the surgery. Common complications include infection and other surgical risks, chronic breast pain, breast or nipple numbness, capsular contracture, breakage and leakage, necrosis (skin death), the need for additional surgery, and “cosmetic” problems (such as dissatisfaction with how the breast looks with the implant).\nStudies of saline breast implants and silicone gel breast implants conducted by implant manufacturers have shown that within the first three years, approximately three out of four reconstruction (breast cancer) patients and almost half of first-time augmentation patients experienced at least one local complication – such as pain, infection, hardening, or the need for additional surgery.4\n\nFor example, among reconstruction patients:\n\n46% of women with silicone gel implants and 21% with saline implants underwent at least one re-operation within three years;\n25% of silicone patients and 8% of saline patients had implants removed; and\n6% of silicone patients and 16% of saline patients experienced breast pain.5, 6\n\n\n\nComplication rates were lower, but still substantial, for augmentation patients. The FDA has a consumer handbook with descriptions of common complications as well as photographs, available to consumers at: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/ucm064348.htm\nIn addition to the risks from anesthesia, surgical risks include infection and hematoma (blood collecting around an implant), both of which can range from mild to severe. Surgical risks are highest immediately around the time of surgery, but complications can require additional surgery later, which will have similar risks. A woman may need to face these surgical risks several times if she needs surgery to correct implant problems or has broken or damaged implants replaced with new ones.\nCommon local complications include loss of nipple sensitivity or painfully sensitive nipples. Some women are dissatisfied with the cosmetic results of breast implants, because their breasts look or feel unnatural or asymmetrical, or they can hear a “sloshing sound” from saline-filled implants. Problems like these can interfere with sexual intimacy.\nScar tissue that forms around any implant or foreign body can become hard or tight around the implant. This common problem is called capsular contracture. The scar tissue is inside the body, but it can cause the breasts to become very hard and misshaped, and it leads to discomfort that ranges from mild to severely painful.\nResearchers have shown that bacteria or mold can grow in saline implants,7 and have expressed concerns about the bacteria or mold being released into the body if the implant breaks. What effect that might have on a woman, or a nursing baby, has not been studied.\nWhat happens when implants break?\nAll breast implants will eventually break, but it is not known how many years the breast implants that are currently on the market will last. Studies of silicone breast implants suggest that most implants last 7-12 years, but some break during the first few months or years, while others last more than 15 years.\nIn a study conducted by FDA scientists, most women had at least one broken implant within 11 years, and the likelihood of rupture increases every year.8 Silicone migrated outside of the breast capsule for 21% of the women, even though most women were unaware that this had happened.\nImplant makers were required to study breakage and provide their studies to the FDA.  Short-term studies of today’s saline implants suggest that between 3-9% break within the first three years, and one implant manufacturer’s study of their silicone gel implants found that between 3-20% break within three years. 3,9 A Danish study of ruptured silicone gel implants suggests that most implants last for ten years, but by the time they are 11-20 years old, most will break, and after 20 years the few that are still intact will break.10\n\nMany women with silicone gel implants are unaware that their implants are broken or leaking.  Plastic surgeon Dr. Scott Spear and the former director of FDA’s Office for Women’s Health, Dr. Susan Wood, point out that “magnetic resonance imaging is the most accurate way to detect a rupture…Mammograms are often inaccurate in detecting rupture, and if an implant is already broken, the pressure from a mammogram could cause the silicone gel from the implant to leak outside the capsule.”11\nSilicone Migration: Research has shown that silicone gel in implants can break down to liquid silicone at normal body temperatures, and there are reports of silicone leakage and migration from implants to the lymph nodes and other organs.12 What happens if liquid silicone migrates to the lungs, liver, or other organs? A study published by the Royal Academy of Medicine in Scotland found that a woman with a broken silicone gel implant in her calf was coughing up silicone identical to the kind in her implant.13 This has potentially serious implications for women with breast implants, since silicone gel breast implants are considerably larger and closer to the lungs than calf implants.\nDo breast implants make women sick?\nA more controversial question is whether breast implants cause diseases or illnesses, and not just problems in the breast area.\nAutoimmune, Connective tissue and Other Painful Diseases and Conditions. Several reports published in the late 1990’s and 2000 have concluded that there is no evidence that implants cause systemic disease.14, 15, 16 These reports, however, relied on research that focused on painful and autoimmune conditions and diseases in women who had implants for a relatively short time — ranging from a few months to a few years. Since these diseases may take many years to develop and be diagnosed, studies that include women who had implants for such a short time cannot be used to determine whether or not breast implants increase the long-term risks of getting these diseases.\nStudies conducted after those reports were published indicated that implants might be linked to a number of diseases.  For example, FDA scientists conducted a study of women who had silicone gel breast implants for at least seven years and found that those with implants that were leaking outside the scar tissue surrounding the implant were significantly more likely to report a diagnosis of at least one of several painful and debilitating diseases, such as fibromyalgia, polymyositis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, mixed connective-tissue disease, or pulmonary fibrosis.17  The risk of these diseases remained even after statistically controlling for patient’s age, implant age, and implant manufacturer.\nDo implant patients who have autoimmune symptoms feel better if their implants are removed?  A study of 95 women who had silicone gel-filled breast implants and rheumatologic symptoms such as joint pain, found that the symptoms improved in 97% (42 of 43) of the women who had their breast implants removed. In contrast, rheumatologic symptoms worsened in 96% (50 of 52) of the women who did not have their implants removed.18 In addition, a university researcher has reported that silicone stimulates an immune response, and cellular analyses indicate that these responses are associated with atypical forms of connective tissue disease.19\nA study of Danish women who had breast implants for an average of 19 years found that they were significantly more likely to report fatigue, Raynaud-like symptoms (white fingers and toes when exposed to cold), and memory loss and other cognitive symptoms, compared to women of the same age in the general population.20\n\nDespite reporting that women with implants were between two and three times as likely to report those symptoms, the researchers, who were funded by a silicone manufacturer, concluded that long-term exposure to breast implants “does not appear to be associated with” autoimmune “symptoms or diseases.” However, the symptoms they reported can be from autoimmune diseases.\nCancers and Deaths. A study by National Cancer Institute (NCI) scientists found a 21% overall increased risk of cancer for women who had implants for at least seven years, compared with women of the same age in the general population.21 The increase was primarily due to an increase in brain, respiratory tract, cervical, and vulvar cancers. More research is needed to draw any conclusions, however.\nThere is no research evidence that implants cause breast cancer. However, implants can interfere with detection of breast cancer.\nMammograms have been shown to detect breast cancer earlier, potentially saving lives as well as saving women from needed mastectomies.  There are several ways in which implants have the potential to delay detection of breast cancer:\n\nAlthough mammography can be performed in ways that minimize the interference of the implants, approximately 55 percent of breast tumors will be hidden in women with implants.22\n\nFDA scientists report that silicone or saline implants can rupture when women undergo mammograms, and for this reason, women who fear implant rupture may forego mammograms.23\n\nThe accuracy of mammograms tends to decrease as the size of the implants increase in proportion to the size of the woman’s natural breast.\n\nPatients have reported that their implants delayed their breast cancer diagnosis.22  Research findings have been inconsistent, but a 2013 Canadian systematic review of 12 studies found that women with breast cancer who had breast implants are diagnosed with later-stage cancers than women with breast cancer who did not have implants. This is likely due to delays in breast cancer detection because of implants. 24\nA delay in diagnosis could result in the woman needing more radical surgery or the delay could be fatal.  A 2013 Canadian meta-analysis of five studies found that if women who had breast augmentation later developed breast cancer, they were more likely to die from it than women diagnosed with breast cancer who did not have breast augmentation. This increased risk of breast cancer-specific death is likely to be due to the greater inaccuracy of mammography for women with implants.23\nAn NCI study found that women who had breast implants for at least 12 years were more likely to die from brain tumors, lung cancer, other respiratory diseases, and suicide compared with other plastic surgery patients.25 Augmentation patients were not more likely to smoke than other plastic surgery patients, so the difference in respiratory diseases did not appear to be due to smoking. However, more research is needed to better control for relevant health habits. Three Scandinavian studies have reported that women who had breast implants for augmentation were three times more likely to commit suicide compared to women in the general population.26, 27, 28\nWhat are other concerns?\nBreastfeeding. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), women with any kind of breast surgery, including breast implant surgery, are at least three times as likely to have an inadequate milk supply for breastfeeding.13 Concerns about the safety of breast milk have also been raised, but there has not been enough research to resolve this issue.  A study of a small number of women with silicone gel breast implants found that the offspring born and breastfed after the mother had breast implants had higher levels of a toxic form of platinum in their blood than offspring born before the same women had breast implants.29\n\nProblems with Memory and Concentration. Women with implants have raised concerns about memory loss, difficulties with concentration, and other cognitive problems. FDA’s analysis of studies by implant companies found a significant increase in neurological symptoms, such as poor concentration, for women who had silicone implants for two years compared to their symptoms just prior to getting implants. These differences were maintained even when the women’s ages were statistically controlled.30 Some experts believe these symptoms could be related to the small amounts of platinum that are used to make silicone gel breast implants, since potentially toxic levels of platinum have been found in the blood and urine of women with implants.28\nUnfortunately, there is no well-designed published epidemiological research to determine whether there is an association between these complaints and breast implants.\nFinancial Costs\nBreast implant surgery is not a one-time cost. On average, implants last 7-12 years, and each replacement adds to the cost. Even if the implant itself is replaced for free, or if the surgeon offers his or her services for free, the cost of the medical facility, anesthesiology, and other expenses can still cost many thousands of dollars for each surgery.  These expenses are affordable for some women, but not for others, especially if the implant breaks after just a few months or years, or after a woman is divorced or loses her job.\nWhen the FDA approved silicone gel breast implants in November 2006, it stated that women with these implants should have a breast MRI three years after getting silicone implants and every two years after that.31 The purpose of the MRIs is to determine if the silicone gel breast implants are ruptured or leaking, because there are often no symptoms. Breast MRIs usually cost at least $2,000, and at some facilities they cost more than $5,000. It is important to remove silicone implants if they are ruptured, to avoid the silicone leaking into the breast or lymph nodes. That is an additional expense of at least $5,000, and can be $10,000 or more.\nSaline implants do not require MRIs to check for leakage, and do not usually cost more than $5,000 to remove. The cost of MRIs and the additional cost of removing leaking silicone makes silicone implants substantially more expensive than saline.\nWhat about health insurance? Typically, cosmetic surgery is not covered by health insurance, and problems resulting from cosmetic surgery are also not covered.10 Health insurance will not pay for MRIs to check for silicone leakage for augmentation patients. In some states, major health insurance providers do not insure women with breast implants.10 Some insurers will sell health insurance to women with implants, but charge them more, and some insurers will not cover certain kinds of illnesses – or any problems in the breast area – for women with breast implants. Obviously, this can be a terrible problem for women who are diagnosed with breast cancer or any other illnesses that are excluded, whether or not those diseases are related to the implants.\nWhat if I need to get my implants removed?\nWomen who have implants sometimes decide to have them removed because of complications, disappointment with how they look or feel, or concern about the long-term health risks. Some surgeons discourage patients from removing their implants. This may be because they don’t share the patient’s concerns, or because they know that some patients will be very unhappy with their appearance after the implant is removed. (See photo #3 at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/ucm064348.htm.) Women with ruptured silicone implants often lose breast tissue as part of the removal surgery. If silicone has leaked into the breast tissue, the resulting removal surgery may be similar to a mastectomy. (See second photo at http://www.breastimplantinfo.org/breast-implants-dangerous/.)\nThe plastic surgeon who performed the original surgery is not necessarily the best choice for removing the implant. Removal can be much more complicated and expensive than the original surgery, especially after a silicone gel implant has broken. Some plastic surgeons are very experienced at removal and are especially skilled at getting the best possible cosmetic result. Most surgeons who specialize in removal recommend removing the implants “en bloc,” which means that the implant and the intact scar tissue capsule surrounding it are all removed together. This helps remove any silicone that may have leaked from a broken gel implant, and also helps remove silicone or other chemicals that may have “bled” from the silicone outer envelope.\nAre there newer, safer implants?\nAs part of new research studies, plastic surgeons sometimes offer “gummy bear” breast implants, named after gummy bear candies because the implants are a thicker, more cohesive silicone gel. Since the shell and gel in these newer models are thicker than most other silicone gel implants, it is possible that they might be less likely to break or leak into the body.\nHowever, new implants often have risks that are not immediately obvious. Unfortunately, no studies have been published in medical journals to show whether these new implants are proven safer than other silicone gel breast implants for long-term use. At this point, there is no way to know whether the thicker shell will last longer than other implants and if so, whether it will last one year longer or several years longer. Only when the cohesive gel implants are in women for 10 years or more will we know whether and how the implant deteriorates or changes when it is in the human body. These implants have not been approved by the FDA because even less is known about their safety than is known about the older styles of silicone gel breast implants.\nWhy long-term safety studies matter. In addition to silicone and saline implants, three other kinds of implants were developed and used primarily outside the United States: Trilucent implants (with soybean oil filler), and Novagold and PIP hydrogel implants, which were filled with a plastic gel.\nAlthough these implants were enthusiastically promoted by plastic surgeons and the media as a “natural” and safer alternative to silicone or saline implants, clinical trials were apparently never conducted on humans with these implants. By 2000, serious safety concerns resulted in the removal of all three from the market.32, 33, 34 The fact that they had been praised by doctors and patients when they were initially introduced serves as a reminder that the long-term risks of implants are not always obvious during the first few years of use. That is why studies of the risks of long-term use – which are still lacking for silicone implants – are essential to establish the safety of all kinds of implants.\nConclusions\nResearch clearly shows that implants are associated with significant health, cosmetic, and economic risks within the first few years and these risks increase over time. Unfortunately, long-term risks remain unknown because of a lack of careful scientific studies. FDA has required implant manufacturers to conduct additional research to determine why implants break, how long they can be expected to last, and what the longer-term health consequences of broken and leaking breast implants might be. Those studies, however, have not yet been made public.\nRelated Articles:\nNew Research on Silicone Breast Implants and Unexplained Symptoms\nBreast implants as therapy?

That can be done for reconstructive purposes, such as after mastectomy for breast cancer, or for cosmetic reasons.\nThis article covers cosmetic breast augmentation only. It discusses the types of breast implants available, the procedures used, and possible complications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaline and Silicone Breast Implants\nThere are two types of breast implants: saline and silicone.\nSaline-filled implants are silicone shells filled with sterile salt water (saline). Silicone-filled implants are silicone shells filled with a plastic gel (silicone). Although many women say that silicone implants feel more like real breasts than saline, they pose more of a risk if they leak.\nIn 1992, the FDA halted the sale of silicone implants because of safety concerns. In 2006, after reviewing more research, the FDA started allowing certain silicone breast implants back on the market. \n\n\nCosts\nHow much breast implants cost depends on the location, doctor, and type of implant used. \nTypically, the surgery ranges from $5,000 to $10,000. Because it is a cosmetic procedure, health insurance usually doesn't cover breast augmentation.\n\n\nHow the Breast Implant Procedure Is Done\nBecause breasts can continue to develop until a woman reaches her late teens or early 20s, the FDA requires that women be at least 18 years old to get breast augmentation with saline-filled implants and at least 22 years old to receive silicone implants.\nWhen picking your surgeon, look for one who has a lot of experience. You may be less likely to have complications later on if you choose a surgeon who has had at least five years of surgical training and at least two years' experience in plastic surgery.\nBefore your breast implant procedure, you will meet with your surgeon for a medical evaluation. You can talk about what you want and get feedback from the doctor. Your surgeon may ask you to stop taking certain medications a few days or weeks before your surgery.\nYou can get breast augmentation done as an outpatient procedure, or you may stay overnight in the hospital.\nThe procedure takes one to two hours. You will likely be given general anesthesia, during which you will be \"asleep\" and pain-free.\nThe surgeon will make a cut under your breasts, under your arms, or around your nipples, depending on your body, the type of implant, and how much enlargement is being done.\nThe surgeon will put the breast implant into a pocket above or below your chest muscle. After the implant is in place, the surgeon will close the cuts with sutures or surgical tape.\n\n","Followers":"","title_name":"Breast Implants","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.webmd.com/beauty/breast-implants/cosmetic-procedures-breast-augmentation","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

C. Kane, a plastic surgeon in New York City. One had bumps the size of capers bulging from her lips. One's forehead was red with inflammation. And a third had ridges that looked to Dr. Kane like worms nestled below her eye sockets.All of these problems had been caused by injections of liquid silicone, one of the most controversial substances in cosmetic medicine. Long used without official sanction and then banned by the Food and Drug Administration, liquid silicone was finally approved for medical use in 1997: to hold detached retinas in place. And it has been gradually regaining popularity, as doctors use it off-label to fill wrinkles, furrows and acne scars or add volume to lips and cheeks.These doctors say they like silicone because it is less expensive than fillers like collagen and Restylane (a gel made of hyaluronic acid), it is easy to work with, and side effects occur in less than 1 percent of patients. But most of all they like silicone because it is permanent. Collagen and Restylane last up to six months, so patients must be injected over and over again. With silicone, once a wrinkle or furrow is flattened, it stays that way.But that means that the side effects, though rare, are permanent too. The lumps and ridges can be surgically removed, but doing so can leave scars that look worse than the original protrusions, Dr. Kane said. \"The small percentage of people who have reactions look so bad that it makes using silicone not worth the risk,\" he said. \"If, God forbid, silicone becomes widespread and every doctor starts injecting it, it will become a disaster.\"Critics of silicone say that because clinical trials have not demonstrated its safety as a permanent cosmetic filler, it is too risky to use for that purpose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n\"Silicone is a time bomb,\" said Dr. Marvin J. Rapaport, a dermatologist in Beverly Hills, Calif., who has collected case reports on 80 patients who have had side effects from silicone shots since 1974. One of these patients had 50 inflamed nodules at injection sites on her face, and she needed injections of steroids several times a year to reduce the swelling, he said. \"Delayed reactions to silicone can happen 1 to 25 years after treatment,\" he said. \"You can't predict who is going to react or when.\"Silicone has been used in the body since just after World War II, when doctors in Japan and Las Vegas began injecting it to enlarge women's breasts. Initially they used the industrial kind of silicone that goes into making furniture polish and transformer fluid. Complications like cysts, sores and painful hardening of the breasts were in some cases so severe that women needed mastectomies. Three women died when silicone obstructed their blood vessels and lungs. In the 1960's the breast injections fell out of favor. Continue reading the main story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1950's Dr. Norman Orentreich, a dermatologist in New York City, pioneered the use of tiny amounts of silicone to fill facial wrinkles. These injections became popular with celebrities like Helen Gurley Brown, the editor of Cosmopolitan. In 1992, however, the F.D.A. ordered a number of prominent doctors to stop using liquid silicone in the face. At the time the agency's commissioner, Dr. David A. Kessler, warned that \"people who undergo these injections are exposing themselves to unknown, potentially dangerous risks.\"Then in 1997 the agency approved a purified form of liquid silicone called Silikon 1000 for correcting detached retinas. Because a material that is approved for one medical purpose can legally be used off-label for another, some dermatologists picked up the silicone syringe again.Liquid silicone, also known as silicone oil, has the consistency of motor oil. When injected into the skin, it causes the body to surround the foreign material with collagen. The new collagen, in turn, bulks up the skin.Doctors use the so-called \"microdroplet technique,\" which calls for only one- to two-tenths of a teaspoon of silicone per treatment. It is injected droplet by droplet into lips, acne scars, hollow cheeks, sunken chins or furrows like the nasolabial folds that descend from the nostrils to the outer corners of the lips. Each treatment costs $500 to $800. And several treatments may be needed before the collagen builds up enough for effects to show, dermatologists say.Temporary wrinkle fillers like collagen and Restylane are made of organic materials that eventually break down. But silicone is inorganic; once put in the skin, it stays there. And that makes it more convenient.Arlene Louis, 61, of Fort Lee, N.J., tried both fat and Restylane injections in the two deep folds called marionette lines that ran from the corners of her mouth down to her chin. But the injections did not fully erase her lines, and she didn't like the prospect of repeating them. So five years ago she went to Dr. Rhoda S. Narins, a dermatologist in New York City, for a series of eight monthly silicone treatments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n\"My puppet lines are gone. I look 10 years younger,\" Ms. Louis said earlier this month when she returned to Dr. Narins's office for silicone injections in her cheeks.Before Dr. Narins gives silicone shots, she has patients sign a consent form that describes the possible side effects. Permanent lumps or inflamed nodules in the skin, intermittent swelling at the injection sites, and permanent red or brown patches can occur years after treatment. But Dr. Narins said that among the several hundred patients she has treated with silicone since 1998, she has never seen a problem.\"Most of the side effects you hear about are caused by nonphysicians injecting an impure substance in nonmedical settings,\" like spas and hotel rooms, Dr. Narins said. When it is administered correctly, she said, \"silicone is a superior product that gives you fabulous results.\"But Dr. David M. Duffy, a dermatologist in Torrance, Calif., has found that liquid silicone can cause problems even when administered by a master injector. He said he has treated about 4,000 patients with silicone in the last 22 years, and he has seen one serious complication (a patient's face became extremely swollen and purple from inflammation) as well as some \"lumps and bumps that are a nuisance.\"\"In good hands the ballpark complication rate could be 4 in 1,000\" patients, Dr. Duffy said. \"In bad hands there are horror stories.\"Lindsay Taylor, a country-western singer in Toronto, said she has a line of bumps from silicone injections that look \"like tiny rice grains\" running along her forehead. She also has a walnut-size bump between her eyebrows and a raised line along her top lip, she said.\"I paid money to a professional to improve my looks,\" Ms. Taylor said. \"But instead I got disfigured as if I'd been in a car accident.\"Ms. Taylor is one of 450 patients participating in a class action suit against Dr. Sheldon V. Pollack, a Toronto dermatologist who injected them with silicone. The complaint alleges that Dr. Pollack failed to inform them that Canada's health department prohibits the cosmetic use of injectable silicone, according to J. Adam Dewar, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. About 75 of the patients have cosmetic problems including lumps and raised lines on their faces, Mr. Dewar said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\nLawrence E. Thacker, a lawyer representing Dr. Pollack, did not return calls seeking comment.Even if no direct side effects occur, the silicone can migrate inside the face. \"Gravity changes your face over time, and the filler does not end up in the place you started,\" said Dr. Arnold W. Klein, a dermatologist in Beverly Hills.But other doctors are learning to like silicone. Dr. Jeffrey S. Dover, a dermatologist in Chestnut Hill, Mass., first tried the injections as part of a clinical trial. From 2002 to 2004 his practice treated eight volunteers with a new kind of liquid silicone called SilSkin. Each patient had silicone injections in one nasolabial fold and collagen injections in the other. Eighteen months later all the volunteers preferred the silicone, he said.Dr. Dover found it so \"spectacular\" for both deep furrows and acne scars that he has started injecting liquid silicone occasionally in his own patients. Still he worries that injectable silicone may prove to be the Russian roulette of cosmetic dermatology. \"You do wonder,\" he said, \"whether this is the patient who is going to come back in 10 or 15 years asking you, 'What are these bumps in my face where you injected the silicone?' \" Continue reading the main story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Followers":"","title_name":"Injecting Silicone, and Risk","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Natasha Singer","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/26/fashion/thursdaystyles/26skin.html?_r=2\u0026","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"26-Jan-06","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

What is this ingredient, and should youÂ avoid it?What is Dimethicone?Dimethicone is what the chemists like to call a silicon-based polymerââpolymerâ meaning itâs a large molecule made up of several smaller units bonded together. Simply put, itâs a silicon oil, man-made in the laboratory and used in personal care products as an anti-foaming agent, skin protectant, and skin and hair conditioner.Manufacturers like it because it makes products easily spreadable, so you get that feeling of the lotion or cream gliding over your skin. Dimethicone also helps form a protective barrier on the skin, and can fill in the fine lines and wrinkles on the face, which is why itâs often used in makeup primers.Is Dimethicone Safe?The FDA has approved the use of dimethicone as a skin protectant ingredient in over-the-counter products, and the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) panel has assessed it as safe to use in personal care products. Some studies have found it to soothe and help improve chronic hand dermatitis, and to help reduce inflammation and irritation. TheÂ Skin Deep DatabaseÂ also lists it has have a low hazard risk.For me, though, this isÂ notÂ a good ingredient to be using in your dailyÂ skin care. Like petroleum products, silicone oils can actually make dry skinÂ worseÂ over time. Instead of sinking into your skin and nourishing it from the inside out, like healthy ingredients do, it forms a sort of plastic-like barrier on the outside of skin.Why Dimethicone is Bad for Your SkinThat artificial coating on the outside of skin causes several issues:It traps everything under itâincluding bacteria, sebum, and impuritiesâwhich could lead to increased breakouts and blackheadsThe coating action actually prevents the skin from performing its normal activitiesâlike sweating, temperature regulating, sloughing off dead skin cells, etc.Prolonged exposure to dimethicone can actually increase skin irritation, due to the coating property and because dimethicone is listed as a possible skin and eye irritantThose with sensitive or reactive skin are at risk of an allergic reaction to dimethiconeOn top of all this, dimethicone is a non-biodegradable chemicalâbad for the environmentI also believe that using these types of ingredients on your skin can actually exacerbate skin aging. Why?Youâre inhibiting skinâs natural processesYouâre creating a dependency on the coating product, disrupting the skinâs own hydrating processes, which in the endÂ increasesÂ dryness, making fine lines and wrinkles more noticeableThe coating properties may increase breakouts, particularly if youâre susceptible to acne, which will lead to scars and older-looking skinYouâre doing nothing to boost the health and vitality of the skin, thus letting aging take its tollMuch better to use nourishing ingredients that help keep your skin hydrated naturally! (Speaking of, check out my new skin care lineÂ here!)To avoid this ingredient, stay away from all dimethicone and similar ingredients like cyclomethicone, dimethiconol, and phenyl trimethicone.What do you think of dimethicone? Â Has it caused you to break out?

At the same time, the rise in living standards in emerging markets allows aging consumers to purchase more sophisticated skin products that incorporate the latest developments in antiaging technology. The global skin care industry has responded by developing products intended to prevent premature aging, reverse specific aspects of aged skin and improve the appearance of skin. \nDimethicone – the Silicone Foundation for Skin Care Silicones have a long history of use in skin care products, beginning in the 1950s. The first applications involved basic silicone fluids (INCI: Dimethicone). These linear polymers are liquid over a wide range of molecular weights. Dimethicones remain important for their emollient properties and their ability to improve the skin feel of many types of skin care formulations. In the late 1970s, another important class of silicones was introduced to the industry. Cyclomethicones are volatile, low-viscosity silicone fluids that act as cosmetic solvents. They are particularly suited for use with other silicones and as delivery vehicles for a variety of active ingredients. \nStarting in the 1980s, the increasing popularity of silicones in skin care applications prompted silicone manufacturers to develop a variety of new materials, which led to even broader use. Many of the new silicones were derivatives of dimethicones, where specific functional groups were added to the backbone of the silicone polymer. For example, grafting hydrophilic polyethylene oxide chains to the dimethicone backbone produces non-ionic silicone surfactants that are useful as emulsifiers, foam stabilizers and wetting agents. Another family of silicones was created by introducing phenyl groups onto the silicone backbone to produce fluids with a higher refractive index and increased compatibility with cosmetic waxes. These phenyl silicones are useful for color cosmetics such as lipsticks, where the goal is to produce a high gloss coating on the lips. \nOne of the newest and most rapidly growing classes of silicones used in skin care applications is silicone elastomers, which are made by cross-linking dimethicone polymers to produce elastomeric solids that have properties quite different from dimethicone fluids. As the degree of cross-linking increases, the silicone network becomes more rigid. Although they are produced by a different process, silicone resins can be thought of as representing the most extreme examples of cross-linked silicone polymers. Silicone resins have a tight, three-dimensional structure that results in rigid materials that can form hard, durable films. Figure 1 illustrates variations in polydimethylsiloxane morphology based on increasing molecular weight and cross-linking. \nSilicone Applications in Cosmetics The signs of skin aging include a number of undesirable changes in its appearance, such as the development of wrinkles, loss of elasticity and uneven pigmentation. One of the most popular approaches used by skin care product manufacturers to address these problems is to develop cosmetics, which are products that temporarily improve skin appearance. Cosmetic products represent a large fraction of the skin care market because they work. They essentially provide instant gratification because consumers notice an improvement as soon as the product is applied. This is in contrast to products intended to provide a therapeutic effect, which may require 6 to12 weeks before improvement becomes apparent. \nThe oldest approach to enhancing skin appearance involves the application of inorganic pigments, principally iron oxides and titanium dioxide. This practice is still used in modern cosmetic products such as foundations and blushes. By choosing the proper ratio of the three forms of iron oxide (black, red, and yellow) and titanium dioxide (white), formulators can design products that cover imperfections and provide an even skin tone for virtually any skin type. \nThe key to achieving uniform pigment films is to deliver them in a vehicle that has good spreading properties, a function for which silicones are ideally suited. This is especially true for cyclomethicone, which helps spread pigments over the skin and then evaporates to leave the pigment behind. Cyclomethicones are available with different rates of evaporation so formulators can control the “play time,” or the time it takes for the liquid cosmetic to dry on the skin. The use of cyclomethicone and other silicone fluids became more widespread with the introduction of surface-treated pigments in the early 1980s. The treated pigment particles have a hydrophobic coating (often silicone or silane) that makes them more compatible with silicone fluids and therefore more effectively delivered from a silicone-based formulation. \nOnce the dried pigment film is on the skin, consumers want it to be “smudge proof” and resistant to transfer onto other surfaces. This allows application of makeup in the morning that maintains good skin appearance all day. Silicone resins such as trimethylsiloxysilicate and polymethylsilsesquioxane are film-formers that improve adhesion of pigments to the skin and transfer resistance. These resins are soluble in cyclomethicone and many other silicone fluids so they are easy to incorporate into cosmetic products. They can also be used in lipsticks to provide long-lasting color with greatly reduced transfer properties. In lip products, a high gloss film as well as attractive color is desirable. Phenyl silicones such as phenyl trimethicone are popular in this application. In addition to imparting gloss, phenyl silicones are more soluble in cosmetic waxes used in lipstick, a property that reduces the problem of syneresis, or bleeding of oil from the lipstick. \nToday’s “state of the art” liquid foundations often are formulated as w/o emulsions. Unlike conventional emulsions where the oily (water-insoluble) ingredients are dispersed as droplets in water, w/o emulsions are droplets of water dispersed in the other ingredients (e.g., oils or silicones). For a foundation that incorporates silicones with hydrophobic pigments, w/s emulsions are ideal vehicles. Such formulations have pleasant aesthetics, excellent spreading characteristics and optimize the film-forming properties of silicone resins. To prepare stable w/s emulsions, special polymeric silicone emulsifiers are required. These emulsifiers are made by grafting hydrophilic groups such as polyethers onto a dimethicone backbone. Common examples are PEG/PPG-18/18 dimethicone, bis-PEG/PPG-14/14 dimethicone and cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 dimethicone. \nApproaches to Hiding Wrinkles Applying inorganic pigments to the skin is an effective way to cover uneven skin pigmentation, but it is less effective in covering wrinkles. Wrinkles are essentially permanent indentations in the skin, and to fill them requires such a thick coating of pigment that it creates an unnatural appearance many consumers reject. In addition, most wrinkles occur in areas of the face that are stretched or compressed with changing facial expressions. These movements tend to form creases in thick pigment films. A better approach to concealing wrinkles is to apply materials with optical properties that allow them to reflect and scatter light in such a way as to reduce the visibility of wrinkles and other skin imperfections. This phenomenon is often referred to as the “soft focus” effect because it is similar to what happens when skin is photographed with a camera that is out of focus; skin features such as wrinkles are “blurred” by the effect of the treatment. \nThe most effective soft focus materials are various transparent particles. The transparency allows the skin color to pass through the particles, giving a more natural skin appearance. Optical effects are influenced by the size, shape, and refractive index of the particles. Spherical particles are popular because they spread well, have a pleasant feel and act as tiny lenses that bend light to create the soft focus effect. Silicone fluids offer the same benefits for delivering soft focus particles to the skin as they do for pigment particles. The refractive index of the silicone can be adjusted by choosing a dimethicone fluid or a phenyl silicone that has a higher refractive index. Spherical silicone elastomer and silicone resin particles are gaining in popularity for face care products. These are useful for soft focus applications because they have a different refractive index than organic cosmetic oils. Light scattering typically increases when the oils and the particles in the film have different refractive indexes. Apart from their aesthetic and optical properties, silicone elastomer particles offer the added benefit of absorbing sebum. \nPrevention of Skin Aging Many skin care products make claims for the prevention of skin aging by protecting the skin against the damaging effects of pollution, cigarette smoke, free radicals and other environmental insults. These claims have some scientific basis, but by far the most important factor in skin aging is exposure to the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight. Countless studies have shown that ultraviolet radiation causes cumulative skin damage that leads to loss of elasticity, uneven pigmentation and other signs of aged skin. The most effective prevention is regular use of sunscreen, which protects the skin against exposure to ultraviolet radiation. \nRecognition of this fact has led to rapid expansion of products that contain sunscreen ingredients, particularly for use on the face and other areas of the body that are exposed to the sun on a daily basis. These active ingredients fall into two broad categories: organic and inorganic. Organic sunscreens are usually oily liquids that are added to a formulation in concentrations ranging from 3%-15%. Inorganic sunscreens consist of particles of titanium dioxide or zinc oxide that are used alone or in combination with organic sunscreens. When used alone, inorganic sunscreen concentrations range from about 10% to as high as 25%. When used to supplement the protection form organic sunscreens, inorganic sunscreens are typically included at 2-8%. \nFor both organic and inorganic sunscreens, the goal is a formulation that delivers the sunscreens in a uniform film to maximize protection against ultraviolet radiation. The film should remain uniform over time and help keep the sunscreens in place so they are not removed when the skin is brushed against other surfaces. For sunscreen products intended for use at the beach or during exercise, the sunscreen film must also be resistant to wash-off. \nSilicone fluids are widely used in sunscreen formulations because of their ability to reduce the oily and sticky skin feel associated with high levels of organic sunscreen oils. Silicone fluids with phenyl groups have better solubility in sunscreen oils and this can increase the effectiveness of the sunscreen, presumably by producing a more uniform film on the skin. Silicone waxes in which long-chain alkyl groups have been grafted onto the silicone backbone have been shown to increase the protective effect of sunscreens. These silicone waxes are solids that affect the rheology of the formulation; they increase the viscosity of the sunscreen film on the skin so that it has a greater tendency to stay in place. \nA number of different polymers are used to increase the water resistance of sunscreen formulations. Many are acrylate polymers and silicone manufacturers have produced hybrid silicone-acrylate copolymers that offer the benefits of both. Other silicone film-formers such as silicone resins have been shown to increase the water resistance of sunscreens. \nInorganic sunscreens are gaining in popularity because they can offer more effective protection against ultraviolet radiation, but these sunscreen actives also can present formulation challenges. Both titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are fine powders that are difficult to handle in production due to dusting and concerns about inhalation by production workers. The small particle size of the powders helps reduce their white appearance on the skin, but the natural tendency of the particles to agglomerate negates the benefits of small particle size. \nFor these reasons, inorganic sunscreens are often sold as dispersions in a fluid. The inorganic particles are subjected to high-shear processing during dispersion production, which breaks up the agglomerated particles. Additives in the dispersion are used to prevent re-agglomeration. Cyclomethicone is a popular carrier fluid for inorganic sunscreen dispersions, particularly when the sunscreen particles have a surface treatment to make them more hydrophobic. Silicone additives such as polyether-modified dimethicones are included to prevent re-agglomeration. \nTreatments for Aged Skin Although protection from ultraviolet radiation is the most effective preventive measure for reducing skin aging, consumers with signs of aging want products that can repair the damage and return skin to a more youthful appearance. This is the realm of skin treatments that are designed to reverse the symptoms of aged skin. Such treatments represent a large part of the skin care market and utilize a variety of active ingredients. Some active ingredients have been used for many years, including tocopherol (vitamin E), retinol (vitamin A) and its derivatives, alpha-hydroxy acids (lactic acid, glycolic acid) and ingredients derived from plants. Advances in biochemistry over the past 5-10 years have produced antiaging ingredients designed to stimulate enzymes in the skin that produce structural proteins and other molecules present in younger skin. Many of these biochemical actives are peptides or peptide derivatives. \nOne property common to many antiaging actives is that they are fragile molecules and can lose their effectiveness via interaction with other ingredients in the formula. This problem has prompted the development of various delivery systems designed to protect the active ingredient in the formulation and make it available when the formulation is applied to the skin. \nOne of the simplest delivery systems that can effectively protect antiaging actives is an anhydrous formulation. This is because water and chemicals contained in the water (acids, bases, dissolved oxygen, and metal ions) are often responsible for the degradation of the actives. Although this issue is eliminated by removing water from the formulation, other problems are created. A formulation consisting entirely of oils and oil-soluble ingredients is usually perceived as greasy or oily by the consumer. Another problem is that most thickening agents used to control the consistency of the formulation must be used with water. So the challenge in an anhydrous formulation is to improve aesthetics and thicken the formulation so it is not too thin and does not separate over time. \nSilicone fluids offer greatly improved aesthetics, and silicone elastomers provide thickening while further improving aesthetics. Anhydrous skin treatment products based on silicones often are sold as small gelatin capsules that provide a single application when the capsule is broken. The protective effect of a silicone elastomer delivery system for certain actives that are soluble in silicone (e.g., retinyl palmitate) has been shown for conventional water-based formulations. The active is first combined with cyclomethicone and silicone elastomers, and this mixture is emulsified into the formulation. The affinity between the active and the silicone is apparently enough to keep the active in the silicone droplets and protected from degradation. \nSummary The term silicone represents a large family of polymers that range from low viscosity fluids, to viscous gums, to cross-linked elastomers and hard resins. Their unique chemical and physical properties have made silicones important ingredients in antiaging skin care products. Although perhaps best known for their aesthetic properties, these versatile materials improve the performance of many cosmetics, sunscreens and skin treatment products. The help deliver pigments and other particles to the skin, enhance protection by sunscreens and improve the stability of antiaging ingredients. \n-Michael S.

Given these statistics, it is not surprising that in spite of the increasing number of women with breast implants, debate continues to swirl about their safety. Many women are justifiably confused by the conflicting information they hear. Here are the facts about what is known and not known about the risks of breast implants.\nLike what you’re reading? Our Bodies Ourselves needs your support to continue providing trusted health info!Donate NowAfter a brief history of breast implants in the United States, we will answer the following questions:\n\nWhat are the known risks?\nWhat happens when breast implants break?\nDo breast implants make women sick?\nWhat are other concerns?\nWhat if I need to get my implants removed?\nAre there newer, safer implants?\n\nHistory of BREAST Implants\nLearn what you can do to ensure women are fully informed about their options and are able to remove implants when their health is at risk \u003e\u003e\nBreast implants made with silicone envelopes and filled with silicone gel or saline (salt water) were first sold in the United States in the 1960s, but sales were relatively slow until the 1980s. By 1990, however, almost 1 million women had undergone breast implant surgery, even though no safety studies had been published. Most of those women had silicone gel breast implants, which the plastic surgeons preferred.\nAlthough most medical products must be proven safe and effective before they can be sold in the United States, that was not true for implanted medical devices sold before 1976.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not require that companies selling silicone breast implants prove that their implants were safe until 1991 — after they had been in use for almost three decades.\nFor the first time, the media started to report about women with implant problems, and quoted doctors who were concerned about implant safety. When the studies were provided to the FDA, the safety data were found to be inadequate to warrant FDA approval.\nThe FDA did not require implant makers to prove that their saline implants were safe until 2000, when, despite high complication rates, the FDA approved saline breast implants for the first time.\nSilicone gel breast implants were approved for the first time in November 2006. Between 1992 and 2006, silicone implants were restricted to clinical trials that were primarily for cancer patients and women with broken implants. Patients were required to be informed that the implants were not approved by the FDA and to be regularly evaluated by their plastic surgeons as part of the study, in order to provide safety data intended to help all women with gel implants.\nAlthough silicone gel breast implants made by two manufacturers were approved in November 2006, there are still restrictions. For example, they are only approved for women over the age of 22.\nWhat are the known risks?\nReports of complications among women with implants have been published in medical journals and discussed at public FDA meetings. There are a number of short-term and long-term risks that women thinking about getting breast implants or about removing or replacing older implants need to be aware of.\nLocal complications refer to problems that occur in the breast area that are obviously related to the breast implants or the surgery. Common complications include infection and other surgical risks, chronic breast pain, breast or nipple numbness, capsular contracture, breakage and leakage, necrosis (skin death), the need for additional surgery, and cosmetic problems — such as dissatisfaction with how the breast looks with the implant).\nStudies of saline breast implants and silicone gel breast implants conducted by implant manufacturers have shown that within the first three years, approximately three out of four reconstruction (breast cancer) patients and almost half of first-time augmentation patients experienced at least one local complication – – such as pain, infection, hardening, or the need for additional surgery.\nFor example, among reconstruction patients:\n\n46 percent of women with silicone gel implants and 21 percent with saline implants underwent at least one re-operation within three years;\n25 percent of silicone patients and 8 percent of saline patients had implants removed\n6 percent of silicone patients and 16 percent of saline patients experienced breast pain\n\nComplication rates were lower, but still substantial, for augmentation patients.\nIn addition to the risks from anesthesia, surgical risks include infection and hematoma (blood collecting around an implant), both of which can range from mild to severe. Surgical risks are highest immediately around the time of surgery, but complications can require additional surgery later, which will have similar risks. A woman may need to face these surgical risks several times if she needs surgery to correct implant problems or has broken or damaged implants replaced with new ones.\nCommon local complications include loss of nipple sensitivity or painfully sensitive nipples. Some women are dissatisfied with the cosmetic results of breast implants, because their breasts look or feel unnatural or asymmetrical, or they can hear a “sloshing sound” from saline-filled implants. Problems like these can interfere with sexual intimacy.\nScar tissue that forms around any implant or foreign body can become hard or tight around the implant. This common problem is called capsular contracture. The scar tissue is inside the body, but it can cause the breasts to become very hard and misshaped, and it leads to discomfort that ranges from mild to severely painful.\nResearchers have shown that bacteria or mold can grow in saline implants, and have expressed concerns about the bacteria or mold being released into the body if the implant breaks. What effect that might have on a woman, or a nursing baby, has yet to be studied.\nThe FDA has a consumer handbook with descriptions of common complications, as well as photographs.\nWhat happens when implants break?\nAll breast implants will eventually break, but it is not known how many years the breast implants that are currently on the market will last. Studies of silicone breast implants suggest that most implants last seven to 12 years, but some break during the first few months or years, while others last more than 15 years.\nIn a study conducted by FDA scientists, most women had at least one broken implant within 11 years, and the likelihood of rupture increases every year. Silicone migrated outside of the breast capsule for 21 percent of the women, even though most women were unaware that this had happened.\nSilicone Migration\nResearch has shown that silicone gel in implants can break down to liquid silicone at normal body temperatures, and there are reports of silicone leakage and migration from implants to the lymph nodes and other organs.\nWhat happens if liquid silicone migrates to the lungs, liver, or other organs? A case report published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine in Scotland found that a woman with a broken silicone gel implant in her calf was coughing up silicone identical to the kind in her implant. This has potentially serious implications for women with breast implants, since silicone gel breast implants are considerably larger and closer to the lungs than calf implants.\nDo breast implants make women sick?\nA more controversial question is whether breast implants cause diseases or illnesses, and not just problems in the breast area.\nAuto-immune diseases\nSeveral reports have concluded that there is no evidence that implants cause systemic disease. These reports, however, relied on research that focused on autoimmune or connective-tissue diseases in women who had implants for a relatively short time — ranging from a few months to a few years. Since connective-tissue and autoimmune diseases may take many years to develop and be diagnosed, studies that include women who had implants for such a short time cannot be used to determine whether or not breast implants increase the long-term risks of getting these diseases.\nStudies conducted after these reports were published indicated that implants may be linked to autoimmune diseases. For example, FDA scientists conducted a study of women who had silicone gel breast implants for at least seven years and found that those with leaking implants were significantly more likely to report fibromyalgia, a painful autoimmune disease.\nThe risk of fibromyalgia remained even after statistically controlling for patient’s age, implant age, and implant manufacturer. These researchers also found that women with leaking silicone implants were significantly more likely to report a diagnosis of at least one of the following painful and debilitating diseases: dermatomyositis, polymyositis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, mixed connective-tissue disease, pulmonary fibrosis, eosinophilic fasciitis, and polymyalgia.\nDo implant patients who have autoimmune symptoms feel better if their implants are removed?  A study of 52 women who had silicone gel-filled breast implants and symptoms such as fatigue and muscle and joint pain found that the symptoms improved significantly in 36 out of 52 women who had their breast implants removed.\nA study of Danish women who had breast implants for an average of 19 years found that they were significantly more likely to report fatigue, Raynaud-like symptoms (white fingers and toes when exposed to cold), and memory loss and other cognitive symptoms, compared to women of the same age in the general population.\nDespite reporting that women with implants were between two and three times as likely to report those symptoms, the researchers, who were funded by a silicone manufacturer, concluded that long-term exposure to breast implants “does not appear to be associated with” autoimmune “symptoms or diseases.” However, the symptoms they reported can be from autoimmune diseases.\nCancers and Deaths\nThere is no research evidence that implants cause breast cancer. However, implants can interfere with detection of breast cancer.\nMammograms have been shown to detect breast cancer earlier, potentially saving lives as well as saving women from needed mastectomies.  There are several ways in which implants have the potential to delay detection of breast cancer:\n\nAlthough mammography can be performed in ways that minimize the interference of the implants, approximately 55 percent of breast tumors will be hidden in women with implants.\nFDA scientists report that silicone or saline implants can rupture when women undergo mammograms, and for this reason, women who fear implant rupture may forego mammograms.\nThe accuracy of mammograms tends to decrease as the size of the implants increase in proportion to the size of the woman’s natural breast.\n\nPatients have reported that their implants delayed their breast cancer diagnosis. Research findings have been inconsistent, but a 2013 Canadian systematic review found that women with breast cancer who had breast implants are diagnosed with later-stage cancers than women with breast cancer who did not have implants. This is likely due to delays in breast cancer detection because of implants.\nA delay in diagnosis could result in the woman needing more radical surgery or the delay could be fatal.  The Canadian meta-analysis found that if women who had breast augmentation later developed breast cancer, they were more likely to die from it than women diagnosed with breast cancer who did not have breast augmentation. This increased risk of breast cancer-specific death is likely to be due to the greater inaccuracy of mammography for women with implants.\nAn NCI study found that women who had breast implants for at least 12 years were more likely to die from brain tumors, lung cancer, other respiratory diseases, and suicide compared with other plastic surgery patients. Augmentation patients were not more likely to smoke than other plastic surgery patients, so the difference in respiratory diseases did not appear to be due to smoking.\nA 2016 review of research on women’s well-being and quality of life after getting breast implants indicates that women who get implants are more likely to commit suicide than women who don’t get implants.\nWhat are other concerns?\nBreastfeeding\nAccording to an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, women with any kind of breast surgery, including breast implant surgery, are at least three times as likely to have an inadequate milk supply for breastfeeding.\nConcerns about the safety of breast milk have also been raised, but there has not been enough research to resolve this issue. A study of a small number of women with silicone gel breast implants found that the offspring born and breastfed after the mother had breast implants had higher levels of a toxic form of platinum in their blood than offspring born before the same women had breast implants.\nMemory and Concentration\nWomen with implants have raised concerns about memory loss, difficulties with concentration, and other cognitive problems. FDA’s analysis of studies by implant companies found a significant increase in neurological symptoms, such as poor concentration, for women who had silicone implants for two years compared to their symptoms just prior to getting implants. These differences were maintained even when the women’s ages were statistically controlled.\nSome experts believe these symptoms could be related to the small amounts of platinum that are used to make silicone gel breast implants, since potentially toxic levels of platinum have been found in the blood and urine of women with implants.\nUnfortunately, there is no well-designed published epidemiological research to determine whether there is an association between these complaints and breast implants.\nFinancial Costs\nBreast implant surgery is not a one-time cost. On average, implants last seven to 12 years, and each replacement adds to the cost. Even if the implant itself is replaced for free, or if the surgeon offers his or her services for free, the cost of the medical facility, anesthesiology, and other expenses can still cost many thousands of dollars for each surgery. These expenses are affordable for some women, but not for others, especially if the implant breaks after just a few months or years, or after a woman is divorced or loses her job.\nWhen the FDA approved silicone gel breast implants in November 2006, it stated that women with these implants should have a breast MRI three years after getting silicone implants and every two years after that. The purpose of the MRIs is to determine if the silicone gel breast implants are ruptured or leaking, because there are often no symptoms. Breast MRIs usually cost at least $2,000, and at some facilities they cost more than $5,000.\nIt is important to remove silicone implants if they are ruptured, to avoid the silicone leaking into the breast or lymph nodes. That is an additional expense of at least $5,000, and can be $10,000 or more.\nSaline implants do not require MRIs to check for leakage, and do not usually cost more than $5,000 to remove. The cost of MRIs and the additional cost of removing leaking silicone makes silicone implants substantially more expensive than saline.\nWhat about health insurance? Typically, cosmetic surgery is not covered by health insurance, and problems resulting from cosmetic surgery are also not covered. Health insurance will not pay for MRIs to check for silicone leakage for augmentation patients. In some states, major health insurance providers do not insure women with breast implants.\nSome insurers will sell health insurance to women with implants, but charge them more, and some insurers will not cover certain kinds of illnesses — or any problems in the breast area — for women with breast implants. Obviously, this can be a terrible problem for women who are diagnosed with breast cancer or any other illnesses that are excluded, whether or not those diseases are related to the implants.\nWhat if I need to get my implants removed?\nWomen who have implants sometimes decide to have them removed because of complications, disappointment with how they look or feel, or concern about the long-term health risks. Some surgeons discourage patients from removing their implants. This may be because they don’t share the patient’s concerns, or because they know that some patients will be very unhappy with their appearance after the implant is removed.\nWomen with ruptured silicone implants often lose breast tissue as part of the removal surgery. If silicone has leaked into the breast tissue, the resulting removal surgery may be similar to a mastectomy. To see what a woman’s breasts can look like after implant removal, view these photographs on the FDA website.\nThe plastic surgeon who performed the original surgery is not necessarily the best choice for removing the implant. Removal can be much more complicated and expensive than the original surgery, especially after a silicone gel implant has broken.\nSome plastic surgeons are very experienced at removal and are especially skilled at getting the best possible cosmetic result. Most surgeons who specialize in removal recommend removing the implants “en bloc,” which means that the implant and the intact scar tissue capsule surrounding it are all removed together. This helps remove any silicone that may have leaked from a broken gel implant, and also helps remove silicone or other chemicals that may have “bled” from the silicone outer envelope.\nAre there newer, safer implants?\nAs part of new research studies, plastic surgeons sometimes offer “gummy bear” breast implants, named after gummy bear candies because the implants are a thicker, more cohesive silicone gel. Since the shell and gel in these newer models are thicker than most other silicone gel implants, it is possible that they might be less likely to break or leak into the body.\nHowever, new implants often have risks that are not immediately obvious. Unfortunately, no studies have been published in medical journals to show whether these new implants are proven safer than other silicone gel breast implants for long-term use. At this point, there is no way to know whether the thicker shell will last longer than other implants and if so, whether it will last one year longer or several years longer.\nOnly when the cohesive gel implants are in women for 10 years or more will we know whether and how the implant deteriorates or changes when it is in the human body. These implants have not been approved by the FDA because even less is known about their safety than is known about the older styles of silicone gel breast implants.\nWhy long-term safety studies matter\nIn addition to silicone and saline implants, three other kinds of implants were developed and used primarily outside the United States: Trilucent implants (with soybean oil filler), and Novagold and PIP hydrogel implants, which were filled with a plastic gel.\nAlthough these implants were enthusiastically promoted by plastic surgeons and the media as a “natural” and safer alternative to silicone or saline implants, clinical trials were apparently never conducted on humans with these implants. By 2000, serious safety concerns resulted in the removal of all three from the market. The fact that they had been praised by doctors and patients when they were initially introduced serves as a reminder that the long-term risks of implants are not always obvious during the first few years of use.\nThat is why studies of the risks of long-term use — which are still lacking for silicone implants — are essential to establish the safety of all kinds of implants.\nConclusions\nResearch clearly shows that implants are associated with significant health, cosmetic, and economic risks within the first few years and these risks increase over time. Unfortunately, long-term risks remain unknown because of a lack of careful scientific studies.\nThe FDA has required implant manufacturers to conduct additional research to determine why implants break, how long they can be expected to last, and what the longer-term health consequences of broken and leaking breast implants might be. Those studies, however, have not yet been made public.\n ","Followers":"","title_name":"Facts About Breast Implants","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Diana Zuckerman","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/about/contributors/diana-zuckerman/","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/health-info/facts-about-breast-implants/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"july - 2 - 2014","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

Oils, polymers, waxes and more involve bonds of carbon and hydrogen. But a notable exception to this hydrocarbon dominance is Cosmetic Silicones. Let’s review silicones used in cosmetics and why.\nSilicon Molecules\nSilicones are molecules or raw materials in which the primary backbone is based on a Silicon/Oxygen repeating unit. (Si-O–) In the simplest incarnation the structure is surrounded by methyl groups (CH3) and the fluid is known as Dimethicone. Chemists can vary the length of the polymer which changes the molecular weight and the fluid properties like viscosity. Hydroxyl group (OH) can also be included in the molecule to product Dimethiconol. The most common side groups include…\n\nmethyl(CH 3)\nphenyl(C 6H 5)\nallyl (-CH 2CH=CH 2)\nvinyl (-CH=CH 2)\ntrifluoropropyl (-CH 2-CH 2CF 3)\n\nThe silicone backbone can also be twisted back on itself to produce a ring structure.  These materials, known as Cyclomethicones, are volatile and used in products in which build-up is a concern.\nWhy Silicones\nNow that you have a sense of the silicone structure you might wonder why you would want to formulate with them. Here are the primary qualities that make silicones useful.\nSlip\nSilicones are incredibly slippery. When diluted onto a surface they form a film that slips past most any frictional force. So silicones on hair will make it much easier to comb. On skin, silicones make them feel smooth and soft.\nShine\nBecause of the even film that silicones produce, they also make a nice shiny surface. Therefore, silicones are great for creating hair shine, shiny nails, or any other application in which you want shine.\nProtection\nSilicones have been demonstrated to create a barrier on the surface of skin and hair. So, they are useful for products designed to protect these surfaces. Lotions, moisturizers, and long lasting color cosmetics would all benefit from the incorporation of silicones into the formulation. Hair can also be protected from heat damage and color loss.\nDrawbacks\nSilicones are excellent materials and you might be wondering why they haven’t replaced hydrocarbons as teh dominant ingredient. Well, as with most excellent things, there are some significant drawbacks.\nCost – Silicones cost much more than equivalent hydrocarbons. Therefore, many companies avoid them. However, you can get some of the benefit by blending them with hydrocarbons which is typically what is done.\nCompatibility – Silicones are not as easy to emulsify as most oils so there can be stability and production issues. This makes them tricky to work with and reduces their use.\nConsumer Concerns – While it is mostly based on misinformation, many consumers believe silicones build-up on hair or leave a layer of damaging wax. So, if you are creating formulations for this type of consumer, silicones will just not do.\nOverall, silicones are great materials for cosmetic chemists and you should experiment with them in most any formulation you work on. But be aware that they will not work for every application and some consumers just don’t want to see them on the label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Plus\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedin\n\n\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS:silicones \n\n4\n\n\n","Followers":"","title_name":"Cosmetic Science Basics – Silicones","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Perry Romanowski","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"4 comments","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://chemistscorner.com/cosmetic-science-basics-silicones/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

But I’ll try to be make it more sexy than science-y!\nBenefits and effects of silicone in skin products is one of the most passionately debated issues in the makeup world. Nobody has the right answer nor evidence to prove that it is or not beneficial, or hazardous to our health or skin.\nI’ve been using the Monistat Chafing Relief Gel as a face primer for 6 months and it doesn’t clog my pores, doesn’t cause breakouts, doesn’t leave a greasy residue, and as a makeup face primer, works like magic for prepping and priming my face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are 5 good reasons why using silicone on your face is more YAY! than NAY.\n1. Silicone is used in most products these days \nSilicone is everywhere. Just so you know, most off-the-shelf hair conditions and serums; and face moisturizers and foundations contain a fair bit of silicone, especially in those that are waterproof or ‘long-wearing’. The fluid properties of silicone make them feel like silk on the skin and act as a water-binding agent that holds up makeup well as silicone repels water and sweat.\nJust turn your shampoo or conditioner around spot for ‘Dimethicone’. Dimethicone forms a barrier that locks in the hair’s natural moisture and waterproofs it to block dryness from humidity, reduce tangling and hair loss. Now you know why your hair shines!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMakeup products like the much loved Urban Decay Cosmetics Eyeshadow Primer Potion and Too Faced Shadow Insurance – Anti-Crease Eyeshadow Primer are silicone-based eye primers. That’s how your eye makeup stays on the lids forever and why we all love them!\nAnd they are, erm, also used as lubricant on condoms.\n2. Good for oily skin or sensitive skin\nNow, now, I know some people detest silicone-based primers because they flake or cause some allergic reactions to the skin. But for those who are willing to give the awesome silicone-based makeup facial primers a try, it’s good to know that because they are oil-free, and due to silicone’s occlusive nature, are even suitable for those with sensitive skin. They do not irritate the skin nor cause acne (at least for oily and sensitive skin like mine!) because they’re nonreactive and are in fact, often used as a barrier against irritation.\nThen again, there ARE people with sensitive skin who avoid silicone primers like the plague.\n3. Makes your face makeup, eye makeup, lipstick last longer\nSilicone fills in uneven skin textures like acne scars and fine lines. You know, like how painters fill up cracks in the wall with paste first before giving it a fresh coat of paint. With slight imperfections in the skin covered, a smooth canvas for foundation is created and face makeup can last longer.\n4. Improper removal of makeup, maybe?\nSome people complain that some foundations or primers are causing acne or they are allergic to silicone-based products. I can’t say for the rest, but some people have the habit of not removing makeup thoroughly. They use general mild facial wash thinking it removes makeup and I know of people who think it’s no big deal going to bed with makeup on. Optimum breeding ground for bacteria! That’s how pores get clogged. Please always make sure not a trace of makeup is left on your face before going to bed. Sometimes it really just boils down to proper makeup removal.\n5. Silicone is approved by FDA\nWell, if it makes you more confident about silicone, silicone is FDA approved. And did I mention that it really IS in everything? =)\nSo if you have problems with cream or lotion makeup face primers being too greasy or not making your makeup last as long as you desire, give silicone-based face primers a go. You never know, it might be your next Holy Grail makeup item!\n5 best-selling face primers:\nSmashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer Travel Size $16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream $15.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBare Escentuals Prime Time Foundation Primer Oil Control $21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer – Hydrating $30\n\n\n\nMonistat Chafing Relief Powder-Gel\nWorldwide shipping at dolltodoll.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIsn’t dimethicone amazing? =)\n \n\nGet Bun Bun Makeup Tips Updates!RSS\n","Followers":"","title_name":"Are Face Primers With Silicone Safe?","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Juli","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"12 Comment","authors_info":"http://www.bunbunmakeuptips.com/author/admin/","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.bunbunmakeuptips.com/are-face-primers-with-silicone-safe/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"28-Feb-11","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

Called “synthetic polymers,” they are man-made polymers—chemicals made of a large number of similar units bonded together—typically derived from petroleum oil. The more typical name for these chemicals? Plastics.\nHere’s why you may want to avoid these ingredients when shopping for personal care items.\n\nMany personal care products include synthetic polymers, which may pollute the environment and contain potentially harmful contaminants.\nNatural and Synthetic Polymers\nScientists discovered how to make synthetic polymers in the chemistry lab. Examples include nylon, polyethylene, polyester, Teflon, and epoxy. Typically, these types of polymers are not biodegradable, and can last for hundreds of years before degrading.\nThere are also natural polymers in the world, but these occur in nature and are often water-based. Examples include silk, wool, cellulose, pectin, and proteins. These are naturally biodegradable.\nConsider the following examples of a natural and synthetic polymer:\n\nNatural rubber: This can be found in nature and harvested as a milky liquid from several types of trees. It is sticky, and doesn’t last long as it can rot.\nSynthesized rubber: This can be made chemically using isoprene and other chemicals. It can be made to have greater durability and smoothness.\n\nBecause of the advantages of synthetic rubber, it’s most often used in various industries today.\nSynthetic Polymers in Personal Care\nThese chemicals gained rapid acceptance by personal care manufacturers because they have a number of uses, and they can be cheaply made. Categories include:\n\nThickening \u0026 gelling polymers: These are used to increase thickness in things like shampoos, conditioners, creams, and lotions. Formulas appear more rich, smooth, and creamy. Examples include polyethylene glycols (PEGs) and carbomers.\nFixative polymers: These are the ones that help fix the hair in place. You’ll find them in sprays, lotions, gels, and foams. Examples include polyimide-1, polyquaternium-11, and PVP/VA copolymers.\nConditioning polymers: These deposit, adhere, or absorb into the proteins of the skin and hair. They improve skin feel and hair manageability, and make the skin and hair softer and smoother. Examples include polyquaternium-6, polyquaternium-7, and polyquaternium-11.\nSilicones: These are polymers that contain silicon atoms or silicates. They help protect, condition, pearlize, moisturize, thicken, and emulsify. They are also added to cleaning products to reduce the irritation of harsh surfactants.\n\nThese aren’t necessarily bad or unsafe in small doses, but we are using so many of them today so frequently, that sometimes they can cause problems.\nEnvironmental Backlash\nOne of the main disadvantages is that they can harm our environment. In 2008, for example, researchers published a study showing that synthetic polymers—plastics—are “now one of the most common and persistent pollutants in ocean waters and beaches worldwide.” Other findings of the study include:\n\nBetween 1970 and 2003, plastics became the fastest growing segment of the U.S. municipal waste stream, increasing nine-fold.\nMarine litter is now 60-80 percent plastic, reaching 90-95 percent in some areas.\nPlastic is harming marine life, including albatross and other seabirds, who ingest plastic. Sea turtles also ingest plastic bags, fishing lines, and other plastics.\nPlastics are known to absorb pollutants, creating unknown health hazards.\n\nWe talked about some plastics like these in a former post (“Are You Polluting Our Waterways with Plastic Microbeads?”) explaining how those tiny ones in your body wash can flush down the drain and end up polluting waterways. No matter where you find these products, they are similar in makeup, and tend to negatively affect the environment.\nContamination Concerns\nLet’s talk about two specific polymers that we find in personal care products: carbomer and sodium polyacrylate.\n\nCarbomer: This is a class of chemicals made from acrylic acid. They are thickening agents that help control the viscosity and flow of cosmetic products. They are also solvents, helping formulas to stay well mixed. You’ll find them in styling gels, facial moisturizers, sunscreen, shampoo, anti-aging treatments, cleansers, and scrubs. Though generally considered safe, they can sometimes contain “neutralizing agents” TEA or EDTA, which we wrote about in a former post. These can carry contaminants that can be potentially carcinogenic.\nSodium polyacrylate: Also called an “acrylic sodium salt polymer,” this chemical is used as a thickener in cosmetics and personal care products. You’ll find it in cleansers and detergents, and even as an absorbing ingredient in diapers and tampons. According to the Cosmetics Database, it’s considered a moderate hazard ingredient because it may be contaminated with toxins during processing.\n\nThese two ingredients aren’t necessarily unsafe on their own, but manufacturing processes can result in contamination with unwanted ingredients. The problem is, there’s no way to tell by looking at the bottle whether a product may contain contaminated polymers.\nBottom Line\nPolymers are a complex, large class of chemicals, so we can’t really list them all or all the specific safety concerns of each one in one post. In addition, there just aren’t enough scientific studies out there yet examining the long-term use of a combination of these ingredients, such as many people are exposed to today.\nWe will continue to keep you updated as more information comes in about specific synthetic polymers and their potential risks. In the meantime, we just wanted to let you know a little bit about them—and of course, to remind you that we don’t use any of these in Annmarie Gianni Skin Care products.\nHave you heard about concerns with synthetic polymers?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5768366e94c25d5de00c7356"},"tag_v1":["Silicone"],"Pinterest":"","authors_point_of_view":"against","Comments":"","article_data":"\nUnder the general name of “silicone” exists a family of synthetic oils that have different chemical structures and accordingly possess diverse properties. For example, volatile silicones are known to bring a light and smooth feeling to cosmetic formulations, while high molecular silicone grades and silicone derivatives are usually included in hair care formulations for conditioning, shine or even strengthening effects. But in January 2009, the Canadian Environmental Protection concluded that siloxanes D4 and D5 are not a concern for human health but that they are harmful for the environment.1 The EU commission is currently evaluating D4 and D5 silicones for final PBT (Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic) classification. If they are classified as PBTs, they may be banned for use in personal care products under the REACH regulation within the EU.2 At the same time, more consumers are aware of the impact that products can have on the environment, and are looking for personal care ingredients that serve as silicone alternatives.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009Fig.1: In a climate room, 4 mg of emollient is applied to the test person’s inner forearms which have been lightly cleaned with cotton wool and ethanol; transparent paper is then pressed onto the area 10 minutes after application, and the resulted surface area is determined in mm²/10 min\n\n\n\nThese important market developments are already anticipated by many finished goods producers. The number of products launched claiming to be “silicone-free” has increased dramatically in the past three years, for instance with more than 300 product launches in Europe in 2009.3 To serve this growing demand, manufacturers are striving to enhance their raw material portfolio. Cognis’ researchers support them in seeking innovative ingredients that work as silicone alternatives. This article presents solutions for silicone-free hair and skin care formulations.\n\nA Pleasant Skin Feel \nIn order to bring the same lightness as cyclic silicone in leave-on products, short chain esters, carbonates or ethers with a high spreading value can be used. The spreadability of an emollient is a decisive factor for the sensory properties of an emulsion.4 In addition, fast spreading emollients help the emulsion to spread homogeneously and uniformly on the skin to evenly distribute active ingredients.\n\nZeidler describes a classification system for cosmetic emollients based on their slow, medium or fast spreading behavior on the skin.4 The method used to determine the spreadability is shown in Fig. 1. If a cosmetic emulsion is formulated exclusively on the basis of fast spreading emollients, the desired smooth, silky skin sensation fades away very quickly, and it is replaced shortly after by a waxy sensation on the skin which relates to the amount of non-spreading substances; e.g., consistency waxes or emulsifiers that are present.4 In contrast, slow spreading emollients (e.g., vegetable oils) give a less remarkable sensation of smoothness, which remains virtually unchanged over time. Ideally, slow oils are combined with fast and medium spreading emollients to give a “spreading cascade,” avoiding gaps in the imparted sensation of smoothness.\n\nOne of the first light emollients in the market, dicaprylyl ether (Cetiol OE, Cognis), combines a very high spreadability (1 600 mm²/10 min) with good stability. This fully vegetable derived ingredient is hydrolysis stable, suitable for formulations with a wide pH range, and especially relevant for AP/deo applications.\n\nAnother example is dicaprylyl carbonate (Cetiol CC, Cognis), a fast-spreading dry emollient (1 600 mm²/10 min), which can significantly improve the sensory performance of the final formulation. It is highly compatible with many different skin types and easy to emulsify. Its good ability to dissolve crystalline UV filters and to disperse pigments makes it particularly suitable for sun care and decorative products. Additionally, it balances the impact of oily and slow spreading UV-filters on the skin feel.\n\nWith the right emollient, consumers can take care of their skin and truly enjoy an inspiring and satisfying experience at the same time.5 Propylheptyl caprylate (Cetiol SenSoft, Cognis) was developed to serve this trend. Sensory assessments have shown that this emollient has multi-dimensional softness and leaves a silky and velvety feel on the skin. It also has a very high spreading value of 1 900 mm²/10 min.\n\nNew coco-caprylate (Cetiol C5, Cognis) is a readily biodegradable light emollient recommended for use in BDIH and NaTrue-compliant as well as traditional formulations. The Ecocert-approved ingredient is derived from 100% natural, renewable feedstocks and has a spreadability of 1,300 mm2/10 minutes. Sensory assessments done by trained panelists have proven that the sensorial profile of this emollient comes very close to the ones of cyclomethicone—it provides the formulation a pleasant and light skin feel (see formula above and Fig. 3 on p. 70). Compared to cyclic siloxanes and alkane alternatives, it is easy to emulsify, has medium polarity and a high flash point (over 140°C). This makes it ideal for facial, body, sun and hair care products as well as decorative cosmetics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009Fig. 2: Moisturizing day cream formulation based on Cetiol C5\n\n\n\n\nSensory modifiers and smoothing agents can also improve the velvety skin feeling of a leave-on product. Used in addition to the right emollient, they can enhance the final sensorial experience. Cosmedia Gel CC (INCI: Dicaprylyl carbonate (and) stearalkonium hectorite (and) propylene carbonate), for instance, is a new version of a hectorite dispersion. The organo-clay platelets impart lubricity by reducing stickiness. It is used as a texture agent and creates a very homogeneous film on the skin providing a melting texture with a velvety matte finish. It also helps to stabilize the emulsion and to suspend actives in AP/deo and pigments in foundation applications.\n\nHigh Performance Hair Care \nSilicones are widely used in shampoos and conditioners because of their well-known conditioning properties. Consumers are looking for silicone-free solutions, but they demand additional benefits to cleansing properties from today’s shampoo: whether they come in a clear or opaque formulation, shampoos must provide superior conditioning, as well as a perceivable repair effect, anti-hair breakage protection or even gloss enhancement.\n\nTo achieve a strong conditioning effect in combination with anti-breakage, a micronized wax dispersion of PEG-4 distearyl ether (and) sodium laureth sulfate (and) distearyl ether (and) dicaprylyl ether (Lamesoft Care, Cognis) was developed. The formula, which has been patented for silicone-free systems, shows excellent anti-breakage results in a shampoo, which is normally only achieved with conditioners: physical measurements on treated hair strands have demonstrated that a shampoo containing only 3% of the dispersion delivers the same outstanding anti-hair breakage protection as three leading benchmark silicone-based shampoos used in combination with their conditioner (see Fig. 4). It achieves particularly strong conditioning effects in combination with cationic polymers.6 As an added formulating benefit, shampoos that contain silicone dispersions require a polymer for stabilization, whereas those containing waxes do not. Performance tests also prove that shampoo formulations containing this dispersion improve the hair shine as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009Fig. 3: Sensory assessment have proven that the sensorial profile of a Cetiol C5-based formulation comes very close to the ones of a benchmark formulation containing silicones.\n\n\n\nFor manufacturers seeking solutions that are easy to incorporate into clear shampoo formulations, microemulsion dicaprylyl ether (and) decyl glucoside (and) glyceryl oleate) (Plantasil Micro, Cognis) was developed. It is a transparent Ecocert-, BDIH-, NaTrue- and NPA-approved microemulsion made entirely from natural, renewable sources. It is easier to formulate than silicones and enables formulators to achieve good conditioning performance in silicone-free shampoos. This optimized blended surfactant-oil system synergistically improves the conditioning performance of shampoos when it is combined with cationic polymers—a combination that opens up new possibilities in shampoos. During the dilution of shampoos, gel-like particles are formed. The gel phase is created by phase transition during application through the dilution process. This in turn generates the hair conditioning effect.7 Microemulsions enhance this phenomenon as more microemulsion added in a shampoo causes a more pronounced phase separation with more gel phase resulting in better conditioning performance. With a nano-sized structure and an average particle size of less than 100nm, this microemulsion enables high amounts of oil to be incorporated into cosmetic formulations without affecting their transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009Fig. 4: A shampoo containing only 3% of Lamesoft Care delivers the same outstanding anti-hair breakage protection than three leading benchmark silicone-based shampoos used in combination with their conditioner.\n\n\n\nSome silicone oils mainly used in shampoos and conditioners are able to create a homogenous film on the hair, and suppliers claim it as hair strengthening or protection. A high-performance ingredient to protect, repair and restructure the hair is the microprotein Gluadin WLM Benz (INCI: Hydrolyzed wheat protein). This wheat-based protein active has a very low molecular weight, which helps to ensure a deep penetration into the hair fiber. This provides an effective strengthening from within, and helps to reduce hair breakage by around 80%. It also creates a protective shield on the cuticle, making hair perceptibly smoother, and contributes to a more pleasant care experience with wet and dry hair.\n\nCationic Rheology Modifier\nRheology modifiers bring the final texture to a personal care formulation. Even if emollients bring the major sensorial properties to a formulation, every ingredient can have an influence on the overall feeling. These details make the difference between standard and premium products.\n\nOne such rheology modifier is Cosmedia Triple C (INCI: Polyquaternium-37 (and) dicaprylyl carbonate (and) lauryl glucoside), a liquid dispersion polymer specifically designed for hair conditioners and skin care formulations. It consists of an efficient cationic inverse emulsion polymer, a high-grade cosmetic emollient and an EO-free emulsifier as an activating agent. The polymer’s cationic charge and the spreadability of the emollient provide a perceivable improvement of the sensory profile of skin and hair care products, while its pseudoplastic flow behavior makes formulations containing this additive very easy for consumers to apply. Furthermore, it measurably improves the combability of both wet and dry hair, is readily activated in cold water, and is effective over a wide pH range. In comparison with conventional cationic inverse emulsion polymers, this additive is more tolerant toward electrolytes, and has superior viscosity behavior in hair and skin care products.\n\nLeveraging the Green Trend \nOver the years, ingredients such as silicones have proven their performance and are still very popular, but more consumers follow the global green trend and are aware of the impact the products they buy have on their personal wellbeing and the environment. As such, they want personal care products based on alternative ingredients that are as green as possible, but they are not willing to sacrifice product performance or convenience.\n\nManufacturers must consider performance factors such as spreadability, sensorial properties and conditioning properties. For example, nature-based emollients or microemulsions with sustainability benefits provide performance similar to that of conventional ingredients. With the right alternative ingredient, manufacturers can develop products that meet consumer demands for convenience, sustainability and an overall experience of care and comfort.\n\nReferences\n1.

The cosmetics industry uses thousands of synthetic chemicals in its products, in everything from lipstick and lotion to shampoo and shaving cream.\nMany of these substances are also used in industrial manufacturing processes to clean industrial equipment, stabilize pesticides and grease gears. And we can all agree that an ingredient that effectively scours a garage floor may not be the best choice for a facial cleanser.\nIn the U.S., major loopholes in federal law allow the cosmetics industry to put thousands of synthetic chemicals into personal care products, even if those chemicals are linked to cancer, infertility or birth defects. At the same time as untested chemicals have been steadily introduced into our environment, breast cancer incidence has risen dramatically.\nFollowing are some of the chemicals commonly found in cosmetics and what they do to us.\nPhthalates\n\nTIPS FOR PREVENTION\nKnowledge is power. Learn how to avoid the nasty chemicals in personal care products.\nTips for choosing safe cosmetics \u003e\nPhthalates are a group of endocrine-disrupting chemicals that are found in cosmetics like nail polish and in synthetic fragrance—both perfumes and fragrance ingredients in other cosmetic products. Phthalate exposure has been linked to early puberty in girls, a risk factor for later-life breast cancer. Some phthalates also act as weak estrogens in cell culture systems.\nTriclosan\nTriclosan is used in antibacterial soaps, deodorants and toothpastes to limit the growth of bacteria and mold. The chemical, which is classified as a pesticide, can affect the body’s hormone systems—especially thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism—and may disrupt normal breast development. Widespread use of triclosan may also contribute to bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents.\n1,4-dioxane\n1,4-dioxane is not listed on ingredient labels. It is a petroleum-derived contaminant formed in the manufacture of shampoos, body wash, children’s bath products and other sudsing cosmetics. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has ranked it as a possible carcinogen, and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) has identified it as a reasonably anticipated carcinogen.\n\nInformation from the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics on 1,4-dioxane in bath products\n\nParabens\nParabens are a group of compounds widely used as an antifungal agent, preservative and antimicrobial in creams, lotions, ointments and other cosmetics, including underarm deodorants. They are absorbed through the skin and have been identified in biopsy samples from breast tumors.\nEthylene Oxide\nEthylene oxide is used to sterilize surgical instruments. It can also be a contaminant of personal care products such as shampoos and body washes, because it is used to buffer the harshness of some sudsing agents, and trace amounts can be left behind. It is classified as a known human carcinogen and is one of 51 chemicals that the National Toxicology Program (NTP) identifies as mammary carcinogens in animals.\n1,3-butadiene\nShaving creams, spray sunscreens and foundations, and anti-fungal treatments that contain the propellant isobutene may be contaminated with the carcinogen 1,3-butadiene. Exposure occurs mainly through inhalation. This chemical has been found to increase mammary tumors in rodents. \nPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of chemicals that occur naturally in coal, crude oil and gasoline. One of the more common PAHs is naphthalene. Some cosmetics and shampoos are made with coal tar and therefore may contain PAHs. They have been shown to increase risk for breast cancer.\nPlacental Extract\nPlacental extract is derived from human or animal placentas and is used in hair conditioners, shampoos and other grooming aids, particularly those marketed to women of color. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) has identified progesterone, the major hormonal contaminant in placental extracts, as a reasonably anticipated carcinogen.\nLead\nLead may be a contaminant in over 650 cosmetic products, including sunscreens, foundation, nail colors, lipsticks and whitening toothpaste. Lead is a proven neurotoxin, linked to learning, language and behavioral problems. It has also been linked to miscarriage, reduced fertility in men and women, and delays in puberty onset in girls.\n\nLead in lipstick?\n\nSunscreen\nMany sunscreens contain chemicals that exert significant estrogenic activity, as measured by the increase in proliferation rates of human breast cancer cells in vitro. Studies show these chemicals are accumulating in wildlife and humans. \n \n\n\nRSS Feed unavailable\n\n \n","Followers":"","title_name":"Chemicals in Cosmetics","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/environmental-breast-cancer-links/cosmetics/","type":"blog","Twitter":"5.6 K","Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

Read more about this in the General Public and Consumer Health Warning later. \n       \"While the skin does act as a barrier, many chemicals do penetrate the skin, either intentionally or unintentionally . . . Because of its large surface area, the skin may be a major route of entry into the body . . . \" (2005, World Health Organization, P. 2 of 9) . . . \"So long as a molecule or ion is small enough to pass through the porous surface of the skin, it will eventually end up in your bloodstream\" (2010, P. 6 of 9). \n       Chemicals can be absorbed through skin into the bloodstream, causing toxic effects. The chemicals may also cause reactions on the skin surface\" (1993, EXTOXNET, Cornell.edu). \n       \"Recent studies by dermatologists at the University of California and a multiple university cooperative team confirm that skin absorption is the major route of entry [for chemicals from skin or hair products getting into the womb]. . . skin absorbs water to a certain extent, which is why it wrinkles. . . . Beyond the fact that skin can absorb chemicals is the danger those chemicals pose in the body. Many experts agree that absorption through the skin is more dangerous than through the mouth. Substances absorbed into the digestive system go through the kidneys and the liver where enzymes break them down and often detoxify them, whereas substances absorbed through the skin go through no such process. \"Chemicals taken in by mouth are absorbed by the intestines and pass into the venous blood, which is taken to the liver,\" Dr. Epstein says. \"Carcinogens absorbed through the skin bypass the liver and enter the bloodstream without this protection.\" (2009, Aragon, B. P. 1 of 3).\n       There's no end of other products consumers can buy that contain hazardous ingredients, including toxic poisons that get into the bloodstream.

(2009, December 18, P. 1 and 3).\nGeneral Public And Consumer Health Warning - According to data from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Toxic Substances Control Act - more than 99% of the 83,000 plus chemicals used in the products we buy are unsafe (including personal care products and cosmetics). The death toll from adverse drug reactions in hospitalized patients results in approximately 106,000 deaths per year. Compare the one year death toll from adverse chemical reactions of 106,000 per year, which is 12.7 times greater than the combined death toll of 8,292 battlefield casualties from 2001 - 2014 (14 years inclusive), killed in 'Operation Iraqi Freedom, Iraq Coalition Military Fatalities', AND, 'Operation Enduring Freedom/Afghanistan Coalition Military Fatalities By Year' (source: icasualties.org, date 3/16/2015). Nearly 100% of humans have detectable levels of unwanted chemicals, including endocrine-disrupting chemicals, in their blood and urine. Since 2003 research indicates that endocrine disruptors at low doses can work together to produce additive unwanted effects. Every product in the bathroom contains an average of seven endocrine-disrupting toxic chemicals. The chemicals in these products have never been tested for safety, nor have they ever been declared to be safe by any standard, or, review of any kind. Chemicals are also found in prescription drugs, pharmaceuticals/medicines (in trace amounts). Even the FDA approved ingredient bisphenol-A (BPA), a known toxic endocrine-disrupting chemical is unsafe. The President's Cancer Panel Report of 2010 summarily rejected as \"incomplete and unreliable, \"FDA's claim that BPA is safe. The same panel also rejects the FDA assertion \"that neither a ban on the chemical or labeling of BPA-containing products was warranted.\" Symptoms of BPA are: miscarriages, lesions, tumors, insulin resistance, prostate cancer, effects sexual differentiation of the brain, disrupts prostate and urethra development, and, increases estrogen sensitivity of the mammary gland (P. 352-353 of Criminal Indifference of The FDA To Cancer Prevention, Samuel S. Epstein, M.D., copyright 2014).    \nAmerican Consumers Believe the Low-Dose Exposures to the Average Number of Sixty-Three Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in the Cosmetics and Personal Care Products They Apply On Their Body Every Day Are Not Linked to Cancer - Nothing Could Be Further From the Truth.\n       \"What You Put On Your Skin Can Be More Dangerous Than What You Eat.  . . . In 2004, a six-month study was done about personal care product use. . . . One of the findings . . . average adult uses nine personal care products each day, containing 126 different chemicals\" (Mercola, J., M.D., Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), et al., 2013). At ENDURE56, LLC we conducted our own investigation on Nov. 3, 2014 on the same number of products (9 each), and had very similar results, as follows:\n \nType Of Bathroom Product And Actual Number of Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs)         \n1. Bar Soap, Actual Number of Toxic *EDCs = 19                                            \n2. Skin Lotion, Actual Number of Toxic *EDCs = 12               \n3. Antiperspirant/Deodorant, Actual Number of Toxic *EDCs = 9\n4. Hair (Root Booster), Actual Number of Toxic *EDCs = 7                               \n5. Body Powder, Actual Number of Toxic *EDCs = 5     \n6. Toothpaste, Actual Number of Toxic *EDCs = 5                     \n7. Shampoo, Actual Number of Toxic *EDCs = 3\n8. Skin Moisturizer, Actual Number of Toxic *EDCs = 3\n9. Skin Moisturizing Cream, Actual Number of Toxic *EDCs = 1\nTOTAL *Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) = 64\nAverage *EDCs/Bathroom Product = 7\n*Endocrine Disrupting Chemical - NOTE: We found about the same number of 126 each chemicals in nine bathroom products, however we were more concerned in determining the number of EDCs. \n        \"It is also evident that both human and wildlife exposures to EDCs consist of complex mixtures of chemicals that are persistent (remain intact for many years) and bioaccumulative (concentrate in fat or protein)  . . . combined exposures can result in a greater risk than exposure to any one chemical at a time (National Research Council, 2008)\" (Kidd, K., Becher, G., Bergman, A., Muir, D., Woodruff, T., 2012). The average personal care product contains seven each, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The use of nine (some people use up to 15), of these products per day, containing an average of 63 total EDCs will certainly give you an earlier entry in reaching \"death\" sooner, than later. Over 50 years the average American exposes their body to 2.3 million chemicals (including EDCs). Approximately half of the 2.3M exposures over 50 years are to 1,149,750 toxic EDCs. At present time (11/5/14), there are 964 EDCs on the list at TEDX.org therefore it's estimated that exposure to each endocrine disrupting chemical over 50 years, would occur 1,193 times (estimated). Over 50 years (research shows) women absorb 250 pounds of chemicals from their daily makeup rountine. That's A LOT of TOXIC endocrine disrupting chemicals!\n        Avoiding the things that will give you cancer is the number 1 way to prevent cancer! The continual topical application and use of cosmetics and personal care products (particularly after your aware of the toxic/deadly risks), on skin is equivalent to having a 'long love affair with poisons.' The use of the word 'care' in 'personal care' products which include numerous EDCs in a single product, is extremely misleading. Toxic EDCs will eventually take their deadly toll on the human body, in numerous ways!\n       There's NO valid and reliable (both), quantitative research literature (that can show the data) from the American Cancer Society, or, the National Cancer Institute, being supportive of the average person in the U.S. applying to their body nine personal care products every day, each product containing seven (7), different (on average), TOXIC endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). No one will tell you doing what was just described will prolong your life! No medical or quantitative, both valid and reliable research literature stands behind, is supportive of, any person applying 63 TOXIC chemicals on your body every day! If your goal is to increase your chances of being diagnosed with a disease, or cancer, just keep on, a keepen on. Everyone has the right to be wrong and pass away, sooner (more disease/less healthy), than later with less disease/healthier.\n       There are strong links (quantitatively measured, valid and reliable) between EDCs and cancer. The endocrine disrupting chemial 'phthalates' is in some nail polish and glitter, 'PBDEs' are identified in lip gloss and eye shadow. \"Increasingly, EDCs at current levels are found to be associated with adverse health outcomes: Chemical - Phthalates (human diseases: neurobehavior, adult fertility, metabolic syndrome, anogenital distance). . . . PBDEs (human diseases: thyroid hormone levels, neurodevelopment, autism). . . . exposure at 1,000 parts per billion (ppb) to the endocrine disrupting chemical DES (diethylstilbestrol), caused weight loss, while low-dose exposure at 1ppb caused extreme obesity (Newbold et al., 2009).  . . . EDCs, like hormones, do not obey \"the dose makes the poison\" (Vandenberg, N. Laura, PhD., Colborn, Hayes, Heindel, Jacobs, Lee, Shioda, Soto, vom Saal, Welshons, Zoeller, Myers, 2012). Between 2005 - '08, forty (40), women undergoing mastectomies submitted breast tissue samples to lead researcher Dr. Philippa Darbre. \"In total, 160 samples were collected, four from each woman, covering serial locations from the axilla (nearest the armpit) to the sternum (breast bone), 99% of the tissue samples contained at least one paraben, and 60% of the samples had five. . . . Our study appears to confirm the view that there is no simple cause and effect relationship between parabens and underarm products and breast cancer, said Mr. Lester Barr, consultant surgeon . . . The intriguing discovery that parabens are present in women who have never used underarm products raises the question: where have these chemicals come from?\" (Press Release, 2012). An answer will be given shortly. In a study conducted a year earlier (2004), the measured level of parabens (npropylparaben, methylparaben, nbutylparaben, ethylparaben, and isobutylparaben), in the breast tissue was four times lower, 20.6 ng/g, than the 85.5 ng/g measured in the later (2005 - '08) breast tissue samples. In regards to the question, \"where have these chemicals come from?\" according to EWG.org (as of Nov. 5, '14) the five parabens listed above are found in many other products, than just underarm products. They are found in almost 22,100 cosmetics and personal care products. Dr. Christine Horner (Board Certified General and Plastic Surgeon) has noticed her patients keep getting younger over the years. \"Could exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals be to blame? . . . A study published last year (2012) suggests that parabens from antiperspirants and other cosmetics indeed appear to increase your risk of breast cancer.  . . . The research,  . . .  reviewed in an editorial published in the Journal of Applied Toxicology . . . determined that higher concentrations of parabens were found in the upper quadrants of the breast and axillary area, where antiperspirants are usually applied. Quite shockingly, the paraben residues were found in concentrations up to 1 million time higher than the estrogen (estradiol) naturally found in human breast tissue!  Clearly these chemicals are accumulating at alarming high concentrations, likely because of their widespread and persistent daily use.  Previous research has shown that women absorb an estimated five pounds of chemicals a year from their makeup routine alone\" (Mercola, J., M.D., Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), 2013).  \n       \"More than half of all breast tumors depend on estrogen for growth\" (Cornell University Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors in New York State [BCERF], 2002). While breast cancer can take up to 30 years, or more, to develop in utero (in the womb) exposure, and, exposure when the breast is developing - to cancer-causing chemicals, including EDCs that mimic the effect of estrogen, do help support the growth of estrogen-dependent breast tumors. \n       Cancer is a huge business that's why we're losing the prevention battle! The cases of skin cancer (melanoma) have increased almost 300% over the thirty-five (35), year period (1975-2010) (NCI 2014). Between the 14 year period (1992 - 2006) the number of skin cancers having nothing to do with the sun (nonmelanoma) increased almost 77%. On FORBES 2013 list of \"Largest U.S. Charities for 2013\" the American Cancer Society is number 8, and Susan G. Koman for the Cure is no. 30. \"In the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society lead committees there are no representatives of individuals and scientists who are knowledgeable and vocal in their demand for cancer prevention\" (Epstein, S., M.D., 2009). Why is this the case? In order to prevent cancer the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society must tackle head on the cosmetics and personal care products industrial complex and both WILL NOT. They will not because the huge makers of cosmetics and personal care products (whose names are on household products in every house) contribute large amounts of money, so they will continue to turn their cheeks. The month of \"pink\" mainly means they can continue to make payroll and grow. More people die each year while they do so. \nThe Story on Cosmetics Labelling\n       On the 'Organic Consumers Association' website: organicconsumers.org/bodycare/index.cfm the readers are informed on the use of words on cosmetics labelling, from Story on Stuff Project video, The Story of Cosmetics that 'herbal,' 'natural,' and 'organic', on cosmetics labels have no legal definition. The website goes on to inform, anything that anybody wants to put in a bottle can be called any of the above things. ALL ENDURE56, LLC products are BIOLOGICAL GREEN™, which is defined (Biologicalgreen.com or natureslovingcareplusshampoo.com - both bring you to this website).\n        Since 1976 (38 years, 1976 thru 2014), the EPA has not reformed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). In the words of the FDA \"Cosmetic products and ingredients are not subject to FDA premarket approval authority, with the exception of color additives.\" In the 'CENTER RING' of 'least-regulated products' the MAIN ATTRACTION are cosmetics. As a result, there are now 86,000 to 90,000 chemicals (a number that grows about 1,000 every year), including EDCs used in cosmetics and personal care products, at best 10% (8,600 to 9K) have been tested for safety. Like a fox guarding the hens, over the last 32+ years (1976 thru June 2008) the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR), has only banished 9 ingredients as being \"UNSAFE\" for use in cosmetics. Voluntary self-regulation in the United States is failing the American Consumer as well as the Health and Safety of ALL AMERICANS! The mistakes American Consumers are making using cosmetics and personal care products, is shortening their life expectancy, and driving UP, the increasing number of skin and other cancers over the past 35 years. Recall the words of Dr. Christine Horner earlier, \"my patients keep getting younger and younger over the years.\" In the words of R. Thomas Zoeller an endocrinologist at the University of Massachusetts, \"the widespread presence of industrial chemicals in the human population is alarming.\" His research work also shows the most harm from endocrine disrupting chemicals occurs from 'relatively low doses'. Low-doses disrupt the effects of natural hormones, and high doses 'desensitize the endocrine system'. What we know from animal research is holding true in the human population, as well. \nMore Research Examples \u0026 Effects of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals  \n A study by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), has found EDCs in the urine of 96% of Americans. In another study, among 2,400 people, the CDC also found 212 chemicals in the participants. Including chemicals that were not supposed to be there. After penetrating the skin the EDCs are absored into the human bloodstream where they disrupt the activities of hormones in human, animal (including wildlife)bodies. In the report: State of Science of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals 2012, internationally recognized chemist Professor Ake Bergman, at Stockholm University, and chief editor of the 2012 report, says: \"We present new evidence on the link between endocrine disrupting chemicals and several diseases,  . . .  Endocrine disorders are common and increasing, and we can show the connections to endocrine-disrupting chemicals.  . . .  The rate of increase is such that the genetic causes can not be the only explanation.  . . .   scientists show the interference increases and that can be linked to endocrine disruptors: \n1. CANCER - breast cancer, endometriosis, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and thyroid cancer increase.\n2. OBESITY AND DIABETES - these have increased over the past 40 years, especially type 2 diabetes, which has more than doubled since 1980. \n3. Decreasing male sperm counts and genital malformations, which are increasing among young boys. \n4. BIRTH DEFECTS - such as low birth weight and abrupt pregnancies - which have increased in many countries. \n5. Premature breast development among young girls, a phenomenon that can lead to breast cancer. \n6. Thyroid problems, which are also increasing among children in some countries and can lead to behavioral disorders. . . . \" (Bergman, A., 2013).\n       Endocrine disrupting chemicals from sunscreens (many which contain titanium dioxide, or, zinc oxide, either alone or in combination should be avoided), are found in breast milk. Proving once again, TOXIC EDCs are penetrating skin and entering the bloodstream. \nReferences\n Mercola, J. (2013).

Yet many of us may not be aware of the toxic ingredients contained in products we’re using.\n“When the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was passed 77 years ago, it contained 112 pages of standards for food and drugs, and only one page for cosmetics,” says Connie Engel, Ph.D., science and education manager at the Breast Cancer Fund and its Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, in San Francisco.\nWhile most cosmetic ingredients must be listed on product labels, sometimes their names are hard to recognize, many are toxic and some of the most dangerous ones may not even be listed. Labeled toxins commonly found in cosmetics include endocrine disruptors that can affect our developmental, reproductive, neurological and immune systems. Here are just a few:\nPolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), also known as Teflon, is found in foundation, pressed powder, loose powder, bronzer, blush, eye shadow and mascara. It can even enhance the toxicity of other chemicals, according to Danish research published in the International Journal of Andrology, and due to its fluorine base, can disrupt iodine absorption, contributing to breast disease including cancer.\nButylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and its cousin, hydroxytoluene (BHT), are common preservatives found in lip products, liquid makeup and moisturizers that the European Commission on Endocrine Disruption cites as interfering with hormone function. They’ve also been shown to cause kidney damage, according to research from Spain’s Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.\nFormaldehyde in many forms, including quaternium-15, coal tar, benzene and mineral oils that are prohibited in the European Union and Japan, are classified as carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\nThese examples represent the tip of the iceberg of toxic chemicals of concern commonly used in cosmetics. They further range from allergens and substances that cause non-cancerous and cancerous tumors and organ toxicity to developmental and reproductive impairment, miscarriage and bioaccumulation leading to toxic overload when not excreted.\nFragrances don’t have to be included in label ingredient lists, constituting another major concern, explains Engel. “Most cosmetics, even eye shadow, contain fragrance, and those fragrances can contain several dozen unlabeled ingredients, including hormone-disrupting phthalates.”\nToxic Ingredients to Avoid\n• Benzophenone\r\n• Butylated compounds, including BHA, BHT\r\n• Carbon black\r\n• Ethanolamine compounds including DEA, MEA, TEA\r\n• Formaldehyde-releasing preservatives (quaternium-15, imidazolidinyl urea)\r\n• Heavy metals, including lead (may not be labeled)\r\n• Phthalates\r\n• PTFE (Teflon)\r\n• Silica\r\n• Talc\r\n• Titanium dioxide\r\n• Triclosan\n\nSource: Campaign for Safe Cosmetics\nThe European Union is the authoritative source on all of these issues. Based on its CosIng (cosmetic ingredients) database accessed via ec.europa.eu/consumers/cosmetics/cosing, it has banned scores of toxic chemicals from makeup sold in EU countries.\nSafe and Healthy Alternatives\nFortunately, safe alternatives are available to enhance our natural beauty. “Become an educated consumer and read the list of ingredients,” advises Janice Cox, the Medford, Oregon, author of Natural Beauty at Home. “Fewer ingredients and organic components mean safer products.”\nBetter yet, we can make our own more natural beauty aids. “One advantage of making your own is that you’re in control. You know yourself and your skin and sensitivities,” says Cox. DIY products are easy if intense color isn’t a requirement. “The color many people want is hard to produce with kitchen ingredients,” Cox explains. “You can make clear mascara and eyebrow tamer with castor oil. It’s easy to make lip balms and maybe get a little color by adding berry juice or beet root powder.”\nFor those that want the look of high-quality makeup without toxins, other good alternatives come into play, says Hollywood makeup artist Lina Hanson, author of Eco-Beautiful. “I had been working in the industry for several years before I discovered the toxic ingredients in makeup; I was shocked,” she says. Equally unsettling, “I also learned that many of the ingredients allowed in the U.S. are banned in the European Union because of their toxicity.”\nThat knowledge launched Hanson’s quest to create safe, organic, beauty-enhancing products for women, celebrities and everyday people alike. “So many people these days pay close attention to what they put in their bodies, but not everyone is as careful about what they put on their bodies,” she says. “I want people to understand that you don’t have to sacrifice beauty in going green.”\nHanson warns against so-called “natural” cosmetics that abuse the term and may include harmful preservatives and synthetic ingredients. She assures, “Any product labeled ‘USDA certified organic’ contains 100 percent organic ingredients.” Her book mentions numerous brands she recommends.\nBeauty Bonus Tip\nHealthy, moisturized skin is essential to natural beauty, many experts agree, noting that younger women need to unclog pores to prevent acne. They don’t need much moisturizing, but skin generally becomes drier with age, making good moisturizers important. Cox recommends jojoba oil to effect glowing skin. Hanson likes coconut oil, although she recommends rubbing it in, removing makeup and then taking it off with a hot, wet towel.\nThe Campaign for Safe Cosmetics (SafeCosmetics.org) has created a helpful app for iPhone and Android users at ThinkDirtyApp.com.

It  is also used in many vaccines and bug repellants.\nA few beauty brands marketed as the greenest in the industry use phenoxyethanol as a preservative, suggesting that it is derived from grapefruit. Well, cocamide DEA is derived from coconut but this doesn’t make it any less toxic!\nChemically known as ethylene glycol phenyl ether or ethylene glycol monophenyl ether, phenoxyethanol is an ethoxylated compound that may be contaminated with carcinogenic toxin 1,4-Dioxane.\nAccording to Journal of Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, phenoxyethanol affected brain and nervous system in animals at moderate doses. In 1990 Journal of the American College of Toxicology reported that phenoxyethanol also acts as an endocrine disruptor that also caused damage to bladder and acute pulmonary edema in animals. Early 1980s studies also suggest that phenoxyethanol can cause DNA mutations – again, only in animals, as it was not tested on humans.\nPhenoxyethanol is a scientifically proven irritant to human skin and eyes (Comparison of objective and sensory skin irritations of several cosmetic preservatives. Lee E, An S, Choi D, Moon S, Chang I. Contact Dermatitis. 2007 Mar;56(3):131-6.) and it is classified as irritant in European Union. Phenoxyethanol is also restricted for use in Japan.\nNo matter what the studies say, phenoxyethanol is deemed perfectly safe for use in cosmetics in the U.S. and UK in concentrations of up to 1 percent. This means, a 200 ml bottle of shampoo contains a teaspoon of phenoxyethanol!\nThe most surprising it that the Soil Association, the organic certification body in the UK permits the use of phenoxyethanol in products that it certifies organic. Please read the organic ingredients on products.\nAll Organic Apoteke products are free of phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethanol residues.\n\nTags: Herbal Skin Care, natural facial skincare, Natural Skin Care, natural skincare, Organic Eye Cream, organic eyecream, organic facial cleanser\n\n\n\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009This entry was posted\n\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009on Thursday, June 3rd, 2010 at 3:53 am\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009and is filed under Facial Skin Care,  Herbal Skin Care,  Natural Beauty Tips,  Natural Skin Care.\n\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\n\n\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009You can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\n\n\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\n\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\n\n\n","Followers":"","title_name":"","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.organicapoteke.com/blog/2010/06/natural-skin-care-the-dangers-of-phenoxyethanol/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

But where did this miracle stuff come from?We owe a ton of gratitude to the people of ancient Egypt, who invented many of our favorite beauty products way, way back in the day — but shampoo got its start somewhere else: India.As early as the 1500s, people in India used the pulp of a fruit called soapberries combined with some herbs and even hibiscus flowers to keep their hair on point. When British colonial traders were going back and forth between India and England, they knew a good thing when they saw it and brought the notion of shampooing your hair to Europe.This excerpt was taken from www.time.com see the link below:http://time.com/3998228/history-of-shampoo/\n\n\n\n\n'Dirty Dozen' cosmetic chemicals to avoid\n\n\n\u0009\u0009    Posted on 4 March, 2016 at 15:45\n\u0009\n\ncomments (0)\n\n\nBy Dr. David SuzukiSome of the ingredients in beauty products aren't that pretty. U.S. researchers report that one in eight of the 82,000 ingredients used in personal care products are industrial chemicals, including carcinogens, pesticides, reproductive toxins, and hormone disruptors. Many products include plasticizers (chemicals that keep concrete soft), degreasers (used to get grime off auto parts), and surfactants (they reduce surface tension in water, like in paint and inks). Imagine what that does to your skin, and to the environment. We surveyed Canadians to see how many of the Dirty Dozen ingredients below appeared in their cosmetics, and our findings show that 80 per cent of entered products contained at least one of these toxic chemicals.1. BHA and BHTUsed mainly in moisturizers and makeup as preservatives. Suspected endocrine disruptors and may cause cancer (BHA). Harmful to fish and other wildlife. 2. Coal tar dyes: p-phenylenediamine and colours listed as \"CI\" followed by a five digit numberIn addition to coal tar dyes, natural and inorganic pigments used in cosmetics are also assigned Colour Index numbers (in the 75000 and 77000 series, respectively).Look for p-phenylenediamine hair dyes and in other products colours listed as \"CI\" followed by five digits.1 The U.S. colour name may also be listed (e.g. \"FD\u0026C Blue No. 1\" or \"Blue 1\"). Potential to cause cancer and may be contaminated with heavy metals toxic to the brain. 3. DEA-related ingredients Used in creamy and foaming products, such as moisturizers and shampoos. Can react to form nitrosamines, which may cause cancer. Harmful to fish and other wildlife. Look also for related chemicalsMEA and TEA. 4. Dibutyl phthalateUsed as a plasticizer in some nail care products. Suspected endocrine disrupter and reproductive toxicant. Harmful to fish and other wildlife. 5. Formaldehyde-releasing preservativesLook for DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, methenamine and quarternium-15. Used in a variety of cosmetics. Slowly release small amounts of formaldehyde, which causes cancer. 6. ParabensUsed in a variety of cosmetics as preservatives. Suspected endocrine disrupters and may interfere with male reproductive functions. 7. Parfum (a.k.a. fragrance)Any mixture of fragrance ingredients used in a variety of cosmetics — even in some products marketed as \"unscented.\" Some fragrance ingredients can trigger allergies and asthma. Some linked to cancer and neurotoxicity. Some harmful to fish and other wildlife. 8. PEG compoundsUsed in many cosmetic cream bases. Can be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, which may cause cancer. Also for related chemical propylene glycol and other ingredients with the letters \"eth\" (e.g., polyethylene glycol). 9. PetrolatumUsed in some hair products for shine and as a moisture barrier in some lip balms, lip sticks and moisturizers. A petroleum product that can be contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which may cause cancer. 10. SiloxanesLook for ingredients ending in \"-siloxane\" or \"-methicone.\" Used in a variety of cosmetics to soften, smooth and moisten. Suspected endocrine disrupter and reproductive toxicant (cyclotetrasiloxane). Harmful to fish and other wildlife. 11. Sodium laureth sulfateUsed in foaming cosmetics, such as shampoos, cleansers and bubble bath. Can be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, which may cause cancer. Look also for related chemical sodium lauryl sulfate and other ingredients with the letters \"eth\" (e.g., sodium laureth sulfate). 12. TriclosanUsed in antibacterial cosmetics, such as toothpastes, cleansers and antiperspirants. Suspected endocrine disrupter and may contribute to antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Harmful to fish and other wildlife.http://www.davidsuzuki.org/\n\n\n\n\nProper Hand Washing Techniques\n\n\n\u0009\u0009    Posted on 4 March, 2016 at 15:35\n\u0009\n\ncomments (0)\n\n\nBy Dr. MercolaHand washing is a simple way to reduce your exposure to potentially disease-causing germs and reduce your chances of getting sick. While not the only factor, it can drastically reduce the germs that get access to your body, especially when you do it at key times, such as before eating or touching your mouth, eyes, and nose, and after using the restroom or visiting public areas. You do NOT need antibacterial soap however, and this has actually been scientifically verified.Hand washing needs to be done correctly, however, in order to be truly effective for disease control. Simply rinsing your hands with water, or giving a quick scrub with soap, is not enough to remove germs. In one recent study,18 only five percent of people washed their hands in a way that would actually kill infection and illness-causing germs. So, to make sure you're actually removing the germs when you wash your hands, follow these guidelines:•\u0009Use warm, running water and a mild soap (avoid antibacterial soap)•\u0009Work up a good lather, all the way up to your wrists, scrubbing for at least 15 or 20 seconds (most people only wash for about 6 seconds)•\u0009Make sure you cover all surfaces, including the backs of your hands, wrists, between your fingers, and around and below your fingernails•\u0009Rinse thoroughly under running water•\u0009In public places, use a paper towel to open the door as a protection from germs that the handles may harborKeep in mind that your skin is your primary barrier against germs, so obsessive-compulsive washing, especially in dry environments that typically exist for most in the winter months when the heat is on, can actually increase your risk of getting sick by drying out your skin. So keep a balance—avoid washing your hands to the point of irritating your skin, as dry, cracked areas are a perfect entryway for germs.http://articles.mercola.com/ \n\n\n\n\nAre You Brushing Your Teeth with Triclosan?\n\n\n\u0009\u0009    Posted on 4 March, 2016 at 15:35\n\u0009\n\ncomments (0)\n\n\nBesides hand soaps and products specifically marketed as antibacterial, triclosan can also be found in a number of other household and personal care products, including cutting boards, toys, acne cream, and even toothpaste.At present, Colgate Total is the only triclosan-containing toothpaste sold in the US, but it's a best-seller—chances are you have a tube in your bathroom right now. If you do, consider this: if triclosan can cause serious health problems when used topically, using it in your mouth is likely even worse, as chemicals are readily absorbed into your oral tissues.Colgate claims its product is safe,12 of course, citing a Cochrane Review13 as supporting evidence. But the review in question actually focused on the Colgate Total's effectiveness in fighting bleeding gums and inflammation; not its long-term safety... Cochrane analyzed more than 30 studies published between 1990 and 2012, and found \"moderate quality evidence\" that Colgate Total is more effective than other toothpastes with respect to reducing gum bleeding and inflammation. However, the authors, Philip Riley and Thomas Lamont, specifically noted that the studies did not allow them to assess any long-term side effects.14A number of other countries have regulations for triclosan, but the US does not. Back in 1978, the FDA said it could not make a ruling on the safety of triclosan due to insufficient evidence. In 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a lawsuit against the FDA over the matter. In response to growing concerns, Minnesota recently passed legislation banning the chemical in products sold within its state lines.The state-imposed ban will not take effect until January 2017, however. There's still no FDA ruling on triclosan, but the FDA has promised it will address the matter in 2016. However, as recently revealed by Bloomberg,15, 16 the FDA knew, or should have reasonably suspected, that there are safety problems:\"Colgate's Total application included 35 pages summarizing toxicology studies on triclosan, which the FDA withheld from view. The agency released the pages17 earlier this year in response to a lawsuit over a Freedom of Information Act request... The pages show how even with one of the US's most stringent regulatory processes -- FDA approval of a new drug -- the government relies on company-backed science to show products are safe and effective.The recently released pages, taken alongside new research on triclosan, raise questions about whether the agency did appropriate due diligence in approving Total 17 years ago, and whether its approval should stand in light of new research... Among the pages were studies showing fetal bone malformations in mice and rats. Colgate said the findings weren't relevant. Viewed through the prism of today's science, such malformations look more like a signal that triclosan is disrupting the endocrine system and throwing off hormonal functioning...Colgate's application materials also show that the FDA asked questions about the thoroughness of cancer studies, which are partly addressed in recently released documents... 'We have created a system where we are testing these chemicals out on the human population. I love the idea they are all safe,' [biology professor Thomas] Zoeller said. 'But when we have studies on animals that suggest otherwise, I think we're taking a huge risk.'\" http://articles.mercola.com/ \n\n\n\n\nTriclosan Can Wreak Havoc on Hormone Function\n\n\n\u0009\u0009    Posted on 4 March, 2016 at 15:35\n\u0009\n\ncomments (0)\n\n\nEndocrine-disrupting chemicals are a serious concern, as they can promote a wide variety of health problems, including: breast, ovarian, prostate, and testicular cancer, preterm and low birth weight babies, precocious puberty in girls, and undescended testicles in boys.According to Thomas Zoeller, a biology professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who specializes in how chemicals affect the endocrine system, triclosan is one of the top 10 endocrine-disrupting chemicals used on a regular basis by most Americans. Hence, removing triclosan from the market could have a substantial impact on public health.As noted by Professor Caren Helbing Ph.D. at the University of Victoria in Canada, the chemical structure of triclosan is similar to both thyroid hormones and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This similarity allows it to attach to your hormone receptors.Helbing's research shows that tadpoles exposed to triclosan suffered stunted development and leg deformations. The metamorphic process these frogs undergo is mediated by thyroid hormones.Her findings were published in the Journal of Aquatic Toxicology11 in 2006, which concluded that: \"Exposure to low levels of triclosan disrupts thyroid hormone-associated gene expression and can alter the rate of thyroid hormone-mediated postembryonic anuran development.\"Triclosan has also been found in community water supplies. There, it breaks down forming certain forms of dioxin, which are toxic to aquatic life and humans alike. http://articles.mercola.com/\n\n\n\n\nThe Many Health Hazards of Triclosan \n\n\n\u0009\u0009    Posted on 4 March, 2016 at 15:30\n\u0009\n\ncomments (0)\n\n\n As noted in the featured article in The Atlantic,8 the reasons for avoiding triclosan are far from few... This antibacterial ingredient has been linked to:•\u0009Allergies•\u0009Thyroid dysfunction•\u0009Endocrine disruption•\u0009Weight gain•\u0009Inflammatory responsesMost recently, triclosan was found to aggravate the growth of liver and kidney tumors, which came as a surprise to the researchers. According to one of the authors:9\"We aren't saying that triclosan causes cancer. We're just saying that with constant exposure, this environmental agent, which is extremely ubiquitous, can promote development of tumors. If one can avoid it, I would avoid it.\"In another interview he clarified by saying:10\"If you have a damaged cell that's been attacked by a mutagen, triclosan promotes the development of the tumor. The compound also causes inflammation, which means that all the ingredients necessary for developing cancer are present.\"Personally, I believe there's plenty of evidence suggesting triclosan is an unnecessary hazard that is best avoided, especially if you have children, due to its adverse effects on the endocrine system.http://articles.mercola.com/ \n\n\n\n\nHarmful Effects of Triclosan\n\n\n\u0009\u0009    Posted on 4 March, 2016 at 15:30\n\u0009\n\ncomments (0)\n\n\nWhy Ditching Antibacterial Soap Is a Good IdeaBy Dr. MercolaWashing your hands is at the top of the list when it comes to effective contagious disease prevention, but many still make the mistake of assuming you have to use antibacterial soap to get the job done right.The same goes for other household cleaning. Routinely disinfecting your body and surroundings may actually cause far more harm than good in the long run.Not only does it promote the development of drug-resistant bacteria, but antibacterial compounds such as triclosan have also been linked to a number or harmful health effects, especially in young children.For example, research has shown that triclosan can alter hormone regulation and may interfere with fetal development in pregnant women.This is a potentially serious concern, as researchers recently discovered traces of triclosan in 100 percent of all urine samples collected from pregnant women1,2, 3, 4 (all of whom were residents of Brooklyn, New York).Triclosan was also found in 51 percent of cord blood samples. Yet another antibacterial compound, triclocarban, was detected in 87 percent of urine samples, and 23 percent of the cord blood samples.A second study5 found the presence of triclosan in nearly 75 percent of doctors and nurses tested. Considering the hazards, I strongly recommend ditching antibacterial soaps and any other product containing triclosan, such as triclosan-containing toothpaste.6Warm water and a mild soap is really all you need to scrub off the germs. Even the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated7 that \"there is currently no evidence that [antibacterial soaps] are any more effective at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water.http://articles.mercola.com/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Followers":"","title_name":"This is a blog which consists of articles of other famous persons","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.ohm-skincare.com/apps/blog/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

The endocrine system consists of an intricate network of ductless glands that secrete natural chemical messengers, i.e., hormones [Greek origin: \"to set in motion\"], and receptors that detect and react to the hormones. The endocrine glands include the two adrenal glands, pancreas, four parathyroid glands, pineal, pituitary, thymus, thyroid, ovaries and testes. These glands release specific amounts of  hormones directly into the bloodstream which then travel throughout the body and influence and regulate many of the body’s processes, such as growth, development, maturation, metabolism, reproduction, and the way various organs operate. A healthy endocrine system enables all organ systems to work together, so that the body functions properly throughout its entire life cycle. The following diagram shows the general location of each endocrine gland and endocrine-related organ:\n\n\n\n\nOriginal illustration created by Diane Abeloff, 2002.\nA hormone produced in one part of an organism causes an effect in a different part. Once the hormone reaches its target, the organ or tissue it affects, the hormone causes a specific reaction to occur which influences the activity of the organ or tissue. The hormone also provides communication among various parts of the organism, thus enabling these parts to function together in a coordinated way.\nHormones function at very small doses (part per billion ranges). They interact with cells that contain matching receptors in or on the cell surfaces. Much like a key fits into a lock, a hormone binds with a cell’s receptor. The adjustments brought on by a hormone are biochemical, changing a cell’s internal and external chemistry to bring about a long term change in the body.\nEvery hormone is affected by the level of another hormone. When hormonal imbalances occur, a variety of health effects can occur. Hormonal imbalances have been associated with an increased risk of diabetes, endometriosis, reproductive problems in women, decreased sperm counts in men, behavioral abnormalities in children, thyroid disorders, cancer of the breast, ovaries, and prostate, as well as problems with sleep, stress, metabolism, and mood.\nEndocrine disruptors [i.e., hormonally active agents (13), endocrine disrupting chemicals (4), endocrine disrupting compounds (5)] are exogenous, synthetic chemicals that have hormone-like effects on both humans and wild-life and interfere with the endocrine system by either mimicking or blocking our natural hormones and disrupting their respective body functions. Disruptors do this by interfering “with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the body that are responsible for development, behavior, fertility, and maintenance of homeostasis (normal cell metabolism)” (3). These toxins can bind to the same sites to which our natural hormones bind, thereby changing, magnifying, or blocking the function of natural hormones. Endocrine disruptors are known to cause learning disabilities, severe attention deficit disorder, cognitive and brain development problems, deformation of the body and limbs, sexual development problems, feminine effects in males or masculine effects in females, immune system suppression, increased levels of total and LDL cholesterol, etc. Any organ system in the body which is regulated by hormones can be derailed by hormone disruptors.\nAll vertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, including humans, can be affected by endocrine disruption. Even some plant species have shown ill effects from exposure to these toxins. However, developing fetuses, infants, and children are more vulnerable than adults, due to the fact that endocrine disruptors can do substantial damage during cell growth and differentiation, and the development of the body’s vital organs and hormonal systems.\nCommon sources of endocrine disruptors:\nUnfortunately, sources of endocrine disruptors are everywhere today, in our food, water, and household products. Chemicals that are known human endocrine disruptors and some of their sources are as follows:\n\nDichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT): soil, food chain, wind, water.\nDiethylstilbesterol (DES): Pregnant women were provided DES during the 1950′s and 1960′s to prevent miscarriage.  While DES actually failed to prevent miscarriages, it did contribute to health problems for the children born to these women, such as high rates of vaginal cancer in teenage girls, birth defects of the uterus and ovaries, and immunosuppression.\nDioxin\nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs): Industrial coolants, lubricants (Exposure increases the risk of chloracne; skin, liver, and brain cancer; thyroid disorders; childhood obesity following prenatal exposure; diabetes.)\nBisphenol A (BPA): Plastic bottles, baby bottles, plastic food containers, dental materials, linings of metal food and infant formula cans, receipt paper used at grocery stores and restaurants.\nPolybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs): Flame retardants used in plastic cases of televisions and, computers, electronics, carpets, lighting, bedding, clothing, car components, foam cushions, other textiles.\nPhthalates: Soft toys, flooring, medical equipment, cosmetics, air fresheners\nAlkylphenols: Degradation product from nonionic detergents which mimics estrogen.\nPerfluorochemicals (PFCs): Fluorine-containing chemicals used to make nonstick cookware, stain-resistant clothing, e.g., Teflon, Gore-Tex, Stainmaster, and Scotchgard.\nPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA): fire-fighting foam, wire insulation, stain-resistant carpets, carpet cleaning liquids, house dust, microwave popcorn bags, nonstick cookware, “Gore-Tex” and other outdoor clothing, DuPont non-stick cookware.\nProducts made with “Triclosan”, “Microban”, “Biofresh”\nMany pesticides\n\nAdditional chemicals are suspected of being endocrine disruptors, including antibacterials, detergents, fumigants, fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, pesticides, plasticizers, plastics such as hospital intravenous bags, and resins.\nRoutes of exposure:\nExposure to endocrine disruptors occurs through several routes. Many of us are exposed through the air and dust outside, water used for cooking, drinking, bathing or showering, as well as our skin and diet, when we handle and ingest produce that has been sprayed with pesticides and/or fungicides, as well as the fatty tissue of fish and other animal products (ex. dairy products, meats) where these toxins seem to concentrate. The increase in household products that contain these pollutants, house dust from all we have accumulated, and the decrease in building ventilation in recent years has also helped to increase our risk of exposure. Homes with wood floors treated in the 1960′s with PCB-based wood finish have also exposed their residents to significantly high levels of endocrine disruptors.\n\nDirect contact with pesticides and other chemicals used in agriculture or the home, e.g., fumigants, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides.\nIndustrial workers may be exposed to endocrine disruptors in detergents, resins, and plasticizers.\nIngestion of contaminated water, food (especially fatty foods and fish from contaminated water), or air.\nEndocrine disruptors may enter the air or water as a byproduct of many chemical and manufacturing operations and when plastics and other materials are burned. Disruptors can also leach out of plastics, such as the kind used to make hospital intravenous bags.\n\nAvoid the following when possible:\n\nDetergents and household products containing nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs). NPEs are hormone disruptors commonly used in many industrial processes, such as the production of oil, pulp and paper, synthetic and natural textiles and leather, and are a component of many household products. They are also used as additives in latex paints and cosmetics, as anti-oxidants and stabilizers in some plastics, and in some pesticides. A form of NPE called “Nonoxynol-9 is the active ingrediant in contraceptive spermicides.\nFatty foods such as: butter; cheese; “full-fat” cottage cheese, cream, ice cream, sour cream; whole milk; meat. Instead, choose low- or reduced-fat, natural and organic versions of these products. Remember, many hormonal contaminants, heavy metals, and other environmental toxins get stored in the fatty tissues of animals, as well as high-fat foods.\nHeating food in plastic containers\nHerbicide and pesticide use; Use non-toxic alternatives.\nAreas recently sprayed with herbicides and/or pesticides.\nLiquid Soaps: Some, like “Softsoap”, contain “Triclosan,” an antibacterial agent that has been associated with hormone disruption.\nLotions: Some contain phthalates.\nMercury: Mercury is used to produce button-type batteries, chlorine, fluorescent lights, pesticides, polyurethane, and thermometers, and is a component of mercury amalgam dental fillings. Request composite, gold, or porcelain fillings from your dentist, instead of mercury amalgam.\nBatteries: Properly dispose of all dead batteries as hazardous waste, since batteries often contain cadmium, lead, and/or mercury. “Lowe’s Home Improvement” stores provide recycling containers for such batteries in their lobbies.\nPlastics and synthetic products: Plastics often contain two chemicals considered to be hormone disruptors: bisphenol A (a key ingredient in certain kinds of hard plastics, the epoxy lining of cans used for canned foods, and some dental sealants) and phthalates (used to soften plastics).\nDirect contact between plastic cling wrap and food, especially hot fatty food.\nStoring fatty foods in plastic containers or plastic wrap\nNonstick cookware\nProcessed and refined foods.\nProducts containing “Triclosan”: An antibacterial and antifungal (disinfectant) agent found in many common household products such as acne medications, antimicrobial creams, cosmetics, deodorants, detergents, dishwashing liquids, hand sanitizers, lotions, skin cleansers, toothpaste, mouthwashes, kitchen sponges, soaps such as “Softsoap”, various plastics including children’s toys, paint, wallpaper, flooring, textiles, curtains, sandal foot beds, public railings, keyboards, countertops, faucets, even dog bowls. It is being added to an increased number of consumer products including kitchen utensils, cutting boards, socks, and trash bags.Linens may be treated with this antimicrobial treatment in the near future. (See list below).\nProducts containing “Microban” or “Biofresh”: “Triclosan” goes by the trade name “Microban” when used in plastics and clothing, and as “Biofresh” when used in acrylic fibers.\nShampoos and conditioners\nStain-resistant fabrics\nSunscreens: Choose organic, chemical-free, “for sensitive skin” versions of these.\nVinyl (PVC) blinds: These contain polyvinylchloride (PVC).\n\nTo further reduce your exposure to endocrine disruptors:\n\nEducate yourself, your family, and friends about endocrine disruptors.\nWash your hands and those of your children often, and always before eating.\nHeat cold water for cooking instead of using hot tap water.\nAllow cold (not hot) water to flow from the water tap, after long period of disuse, in order to flush out lead-contaminated water.\nEat lower on the food chain and include a variety of beans, legumes, nuts and seeds, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\nEat fewer and smaller portions of fatty meat and high-fat dairy products, since many hormonal contaminants are stored in fat.\nChoose fat-free or low-fat dairy, fish, and meat products. If you eat fish from bays, lakes, rivers, or streams, first check with your state to learn if they are contaminated.\nWhen purchasing meat, choose “American Grass-Fed” products from animals that had been raised without the use of antibiotics and hormones.\nPurchase organic food whenever possible, and eat plenty of whole-grain, high-fiber foods, in order to minimize your intake and absorption of endocrine disruptors.\nWash and peel non-organic fruits and vegetables.\nBuy food grown locally and in season. Local farm methods are generally more accountable and transparent than those used in large agricultural corporations. Many pesticides whose use has been banned in the United States continue to be produced, sold to, and used in other countries, who then sell their produce back to American markets.\nMicrowave food using microwave-safe ceramic and glass cookware, instead of plastic containers and plates.\nUse cast-iron or stainless steel cookware, instead of nonstick.\nReduce your use of plastics in general: Use food-safe glass or ceramic containers to store food when possible. Use a stainless steel container as a water bottle, in place of a plastic bottle. Provide children with products made from natural materials (ex., cotton, non-toxic wood toys, etc.) that are free of Bisphenol A, phthalates, and other endocrine disruptors.\nAvoid chemicals in your personal care and cleaning products.\nUse non-toxic, environmentally-friendly household cleansers, laundry detergents, and dishwashing liquid.\nExercise frequently, in order to reduce stress, promote health, boost your immunity, and help your organs and vascular system to function more efficiently.\nSupport efforts to ban or restrict the use of endocrine disruptors, and demand better regulation from the Environmental Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration, state and local government and health department, agribusiness, industry, and manufacturers of children’s products and toys, etc.\n\nList of products containing Triclosan (11):\nSOAP: Dial® Liquid Soap; Softsoap® Antibacterial\nLiquid Hand Soap; Tea Tree Therapy™ Liquid Soap;\nProvon® Soap; Clearasil® Daily Face Wash; Dermato-\nlogica® Skin Purifying Wipes; Clean \u0026 Clear Oil Free\nFoaming Facial Cleanser; DermaKleen™ Antibacterial\nLotion Soap; Naturade Aloe Vera 80® Antibacterial Soap;\nCVS Antibacterial Soap, pHisoderm Antibacterial Skin\nCleanser, Dawn® Complete Antibacterial Dish Liquid,\nAjax® Antibacterial Dish Liquid.\nDENTAL CARE: Colgate Total®; Breeze™ Triclosan\nMouthwash; Reach® Antibacterial Toothbrush; Janina\nDiamond Whitening Toothpaste\nCOSMETICS: Supre® Café Bronzer™; TotalSkinCare\nMakeup Kit; Garden Botanika® Powder Foundation;\nMavala Lip Base; Jason Natural Cosmetics; Blemish Cover\nStick; Movate® Skin Litening Cream HQ; Paul Mitchell\nDetangler Comb, Revlon ColorStay LipSHINE Lipcolor\nPlus Gloss, Dazzle\nDEODORANT: Old Spice High Endurance Stick Deodor-\nant, Right Guard Sport Deodorant\nQueen Helene® Tea Trea Oil Deodorant and Aloe De-\nodorant; Nature De France Le Stick Natural Stick Deodor-\nant; DeCleor Deodorant Stick; Epoch® Deodorant with\nCitrisomes; X Air Maximum Strength Deodorant\nOTHER PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS: Gillette®\nComplete Skin Care MultiGel Aerosol Shave Gel; Mu-\nrad Acne Complex® Kit, ®; Diabet-x™ Cream; T.Taio™\nsponges and wipes, Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel.\nFIRST AID: SyDERMA® Skin Protectant plus First\nAid Antiseptic; Solarcaine® First Aid Medicated Spray;\nNexcare™ First Aid, Skin Crack Care; First Aid/Burn\nCream; HealWell® Night Splint;\nHealWell® Night Splint 11-1X1; Universal Cer-\nvical Collar with Microban\nKITCHENWARE: Farberware® Microban Steakknife Set\nand Cutting Boards; Franklin Machine Products FMP Ice\nCream Scoop SZ 20 Microban; Hobart Semi-Automatic\nSlicer; Chix® Food Service Wipes with Microban; Com-\npact Web Foot® Wet Mop Heads\nCOMPUTER EQUIPMENT: Fellowes Cordless Microban\nKeyboard and Microban Mouse Pad\nCLOTHES: Teva® Sandals; Merrell Shoes; Sabatier Chef’s\nApron; Dickies Socks; Biofresh® socks\nCHILDREN’S TOYS: Playskool®: Stack ‘n Scoop Whale,\nRockin’ Radio, Hourglass, Sounds Around Driver, Roll ‘n\nRa le Ball, Animal Sounds Phone, Busy Beads Pal, Pop\n‘n Spin Top, Lights ‘n Surprise Laptop\nOTHER: Bionare® Cool Mist Humidiﬁer; Microban®\nAll Weather Reinforced Hose; Thomasville® Furniture;\nDeciguard AB Ear Plugs; Bauer® 5000 Helmet; Aquatic\nWhirlpools; Miller Paint Interior Paint;QVC®Collapsible\n40-Can Cooler; Holmes Foot Buddy™ Foot Warmer, Blue\nMountain Wall Coverings, California Paints®, EHC AM-\nRail Escalator Handrails, Dupont™ Air Filters, Durelle™\nCarpet Cushions, Advanta One Laminate Floors, San Luis\nBlankets, J Cloth® towels, JERMEX mops\n \nReferences:\n\nAbeloff, Diane. “Diagram of Endocrine Glands”.

Up to 60 percent of what comes into contact with our skin can be absorbed into our blood stream. While avoiding all chemicals is impossible – think of air polluting chemicals – being mindful about what you apply on your skin can dramatically reduce the amount of chemicals and toxins that end up in your body.\nMaking your own cosmetics is the safest way to protect your skin for harsh, toxic chemicals, but unfortunately not all of us can find the time or resources to do so. Buying organic brands is your safest bet, but even these can contain some not-so-natural, questionable ingredients.\nHere’s a quick list to help you scan the labels and decide whether you should put it back on the selves rather than applying it onto your skin.\n1.      Parabens\nIf you pick up a cream or lotion from the grocery store, chances are you will find this commonly used preservative as one of its many ingredients. It prevents bacteria, mold, fungus, and parasites to thrive in your cosmetics. Parabens are easily absorbed by the skin and associated with breast and prostate cancer. They have been found in biopsy samples of breast tumors.\n2.      Phthalates\nPhthalates, a group of chemicals, known to act as endocrine disruptors, linked to increased risk of breast cancer, early breast development in girls, and reproductive birth defects in males and females.\nIt is found in many cosmetic products and plastics to increase the flexibility and softness. However, the sneaky part, it is not always listed and often disguised under the term “fragrance”. So opt for unscented products or the ones with pure essential oils instead.\n3.      Triclosan\nWidely used for its antibacterial properties in tooth paste, antibacterial soaps and deodorants. Tricloson is a skin irritant associated with disrupting the function of thyroid and reproductive hormones.\nAlso read: Is Your Toothpaste Giving You Cancer?\n4.      Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) / Sodium laureth sulfate (SLES).\nFound in over 90 percent of personal care products, especially foamy products. SLS and SLES are not a major concern on its own, but they easily interact with other chemicals found in our cosmetics and form nitrosamine, a known carcinogen.\n5.      Benzoyl peroxide\nIf your lotion or cream states acne clearing, chances are benzoyl peroxide is one of its ingredients. While it will help zap your pimples, it is linked to promoting tumor growth as well.\n6.      Formaldehyde\nAnother bacteria fighting preservative used in many cosmetics, listed as a carginogen by The International Agency for Research on Carcinogens (IARC). It is also linked to allergic skin reactions and disrupting the immune system.\n7.      Petroleum or coal tar derivates\nThese derivates can cause birth defects and are also linked to immune system toxicity. The World Health Organization and the Environmental Protection Agency has listed them as probable carcinogens.\nOften listed as petrolatum, xylene, toluene, mineral oil, liquid paraffin, benzene, toluol, phenylmethane, and methylbenzene. So make sure to watch out for all of these.\n8.      Methylisothiazolinone (MIT)\nA common antibacterial preservative with neurotoxic properties. It can cause severe damage to our brain cells and increases the risk of seizures.\n9.      Propylene glycol (PEG)\nOften used as a skin-conditioning/moisturizing agent in body lotions, sunscreen, makeup products, conditioners, and shampoos. PEG is classified as a skin irritant and associated with dermatitis and hives.\n10.  Artificial dyes and dynthetic dolors\nMany artificial colorings are made from coal tar. They can cause allergic reactions, skin irritation, and many studies show they are carcinogenic as well. So next time you buy a lipstick, make sure the color comes from organic, safe substances. If you see anything listed beginning with FD\u0026C or D\u0026C, better put it back on the shelves.\n11.  Sunscreen chemicals\nWhile it is important to protect your skin from the sun’s UV rays to avoid skin issues and cancer, the one product that must protect you against these rays may not be your best bet. Most commercially available sunscreens are loaded with synthetic compounds – such as benzophenone, PABA, avobenzone, homosalate and ethoxycinnmate – which are all linked to cell damage and cancer.\n12.  Imidazolidinyl urea\nAdded to most water-based cosmetics as a preservative. It releases formaldehyde and has been linked to skin irritation and cancer. Other formaldehyde releasing substances to watch out for: DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, methenamine, and quarternium-15.\n \nSources: Huffington Post, EWG, and Mind Body Green\n \nLooking for a way to detox your lifestyle while eating delicious, colorful meals and losing or maintaining weight the healthy way, click here\nDon’t forget to download my FREE Book “Amy’s Home Kitchen”, packed with my family’s favorite healthy, clean and delicious recipes. Or connect with me on Facebook or Google+\n","Followers":"@Amygoodrich07","title_name":"The “Dirty Dozen” Of Common Cosmetic and Skin Care Ingredients","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Amy Goodrich","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"http://blogs.naturalnews.com/author/amygoodrich/","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://blogs.naturalnews.com/dirty-dozen-common-cosmetic-skin-care-ingredients/","type":"blog","Twitter":"940 shares","Share":"Friday, November 13, 2015 at 11:42am EDT","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

Now my four year old daughter has been asking to paint her nails. My instinct was to say no, even if she uses \"safer\" nail polish. So I asked someone who used to work for a major cosmetics company about her real thoughts on cosmetics. These are her responses: \n\n1. You have mentioned to me that nail polish is really terrible for you. What is so bad about traditional nail polish?\n\n\u0009Nail polish is not terrible for you. The problem is when it chips off and is ingested (by children or by people who bite their nails). The fumes have been linked to miscarriage for women who work in nail salons but the products are probably safe for women (even pregnant women) who frequent the salon infrequently (1-2x per month).\n\n2. Are the new \"formaldehyde free\" nail polishes better? Are they completely safe?\n\n\u0009Formaldehyde has been linked to cancer and birth defects, so yes the formaldehyde free polishes are better than the old fashioned formulas. Toulane and DPB are the other offenders which is why you see \"3-free\" products on the market. Some brands are even marketing 5-free. My concerns with all of these products are the chemicals that have not been removed, or linked to reproductive problems (yet). There are binders and shine boosters that enhance performance, wear and color integrity.\n\n3. Are the companies making these products aware that these chemicals could be harmful? What is their take on it?\n\n\u0009The general consensus amongst industry experts is that children should NOT be ingesting these chemicals. That sounds obvious but when you see a 2 year old with painted nails, you realize parents don't understand this. Children who bite their nails (basically all kids under the age of 8) should not be getting manicures or pedicures with salon polishes.\n\n4. What other makeup products would you be wary of and why?\n\n\u0009For adults, makeup is fairly safe as long as it's free of Parabens. You absorb 60% of what you put on your skin. That makes lotions potentially the most toxic. But makeup, skincare, hair products and perfumes can all contain chemicals that are harmful. There needs to be more transparency on the part of manufacturers about what chemicals are in the formulations - specifically when you simply see the word \"fragrance\" in the ingredients list. Fragrance is a generic term for all kinds of chemicals that can potentially be harmful.\n\n5. Are there certain brands you think are healthier than others?\n\n\u0009Many brands that market themselves as \"natural\" actually are not. You really have to read labels and watch for the chemicals you're most concerned about.\n\n6. Do you see a genuine shift in makeup brands being more careful about the chemicals they use?\n\n\u0009Yes, cosmetics companies are under more and more scrutiny by cosmetics watchdog groups so they are being more cautious about what ingredients they use. I really believe the public can influence this by demanding more transparency and adherence to strict standards. Of course, they might have to give up product performance without the ingredients that contribute to color, longwear and finish, but you can't have it all.\n\n7. What are some key things (ingredients, words on packaging, etc) that consumers should look for or avoid?\n\n\u0009Some other chemicals to look for are listed here:\n\n\nBHA and BHT -Used mainly in moisturizers and makeup as preservatives. Suspected endocrine disruptors and may cause cancer (BHA). \n\nCoal tar dyes: p-phenylenediamine and colours listed as \"CI\" followed by a five digit number. Potential to cause cancer.\n\nDEA-related ingredients: Used in creamy and foaming products, such as moisturizers and shampoos. Can react to form nitrosamines, which may cause cancer. \n\nDibutyl phthalate: Used as a plasticizer in some nail care products. Suspected endocrine disrupter and reproductive toxicant. \n\nFormaldehyde-releasing preservatives: Look for DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, methenamine and quarternium-15. Used in a variety of cosmetics. Slowly release small amounts of formaldehyde, which causes cancer.\n\nParabens: Used in a variety of cosmetics as preservatives. Suspected endocrine disrupters and may interfere with male reproductive functions.\n\nParfum (a.k.a. fragrance): Some fragrance ingredients can trigger allergies and asthma. Some linked to cancer and neurotoxicity.\n\nPEG compounds: Used in many cosmetic cream bases. Can be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, which may cause cancer.\n\nPetrolatum: Used in some hair products for shine and as a moisture barrier in some lip balms, lip sticks and moisturizers. A petroleum product that can be contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which may cause cancer.\n\nSiloxanes: Look for ingredients ending in \"-siloxane\" or \"-methicone.\" Used in a variety of cosmetics to soften, smooth and moisten. Suspected endocrine disrupter and reproductive toxicant (cyclotetrasiloxane).\n\nSodium laureth sulfate:Used in foaming cosmetics, such as shampoos, cleansers and bubble bath. Can be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, which may cause cancer. Look also for related chemical sodium lauryl sulfate and other ingredients with the letters \"eth\" (e.g., sodium laureth sulfate).\n\nTriclosan: Used in antibacterial cosmetics, such as toothpastes, cleansers and antiperspirants. Suspected endocrine disrupter.\n\n\n\u0009See source for ingredient list here: http://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/health/science/toxics/dirty-dozen-cosmetic-chemicals/\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by Disqus\n \n","Followers":"","title_name":"Cosmetics \u0026 Kids - Advice from a Cosmetics Industry Expert","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Suzanne Price","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"http://www.sproutsanfrancisco.com/why-sprout/our-founder/","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.sproutsanfrancisco.com/get-educated/advice-from-a-cosmetics-industry-expert2/","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}

I am Linda Birnbaum, the Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as of the National Toxicology Program (NTP). NIH and NTP are entities of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.Endocrine disruptors are naturally occurring or man-made substances that may mimic or interfere with the function of hormones in the body. Endocrine disruptors may turn on, shut off, or modify signals that hormones carry and thus affect the normal functions of tissues and organs. NIEHS has had a longstanding interest in these chemicals with its support for research dating back to the beginning of the Institute in the 1960s.Over the past fifty years, researchers observed increases in endocrine-sensitive health outcomes. Breast and prostatic cancer incidence increased between 1969 and 1986 ; there was a four-fold increase in ectopic pregnancies (development of the fertilized egg outside of the uterus) in the U.S. between 1970 and 1987 ; the incidence of cryptorchidism (undescended testicles) doubled in the U.K. between 1960 and the mid 1980s ; and there was an approximately 42% decrease in sperm count worldwide between 1940 and 1990 .These observations, set against the numerous observations of abnormalities of sexual development in amphibians and fish and the widespread detection of chemicals with endocrine disrupting properties in our bodies , have led NIEHS to increase its support for research on the effects of chemical exposures on the various endocrine systems. The detection of numerous pharmaceutical agents and chemicals with endocrine disrupting potential in surface waters around the country has raised concern about drinking water as a significant route of exposure.There are four aspects of exposure to endocrine disruption which I want to emphasize:• First, the effect of low doses. Normal endocrine signaling involves very small changes in hormone levels, yet these changes can have significant biological effects. That means subtle disruptions of endocrine signaling is a plausible mechanism by which chemical exposures at low doses can have effects on the body.• Second, the wide range of effects. Endocrine signals govern virtually every organ and process in the body. That means that when outside chemicals interfere with those systems, the effects can be seen in many different diseases and conditions – some of which we are just learning to recognize as the result of endocrine disruption.• Third, the persistence of effects. We are finding that the effects of exposure to endocrine disruptors can be observed long after the actual exposure has ceased. This is especially true for growth and development, processes that are very sensitive to endocrine regulation. The question of how these kinds of latent effects occur is an active area of investigation.• Fourth, the ubiquity of exposure. Both naturally occurring and manmade substances can be endocrine disruptors. Some, e.g., arsenic and agricultural chemicals, are ubiquitous in the environment. In addition to the growing use of hormonally-active pharmaceuticals that pass through the bodies of those taking them and end up in water treatment systems and surface waters, many of the chemicals that are being found to have endocrine effects are components of a wide range of consumer products, including some water bottles, cosmetics, sunscreens, and other personal care products. Substances applied to the skin can be directly absorbed but also end up getting washed off our bodies and into our water systems. As a result, chemicals with endocrine disrupting activity are widely dispersed in our environment, often at levels plausibly associated with biological effects; exposure to humans is widespread.Looking at these four points together, it is apparent that endocrine disruption is an important emerging public health concern. NIEHS is responding to the importance of this concern through our research investments, and we are starting to understand these health risks better, but there are still many gaps in our understanding. We are therefore gathering more information to help assess and manage EDCs appropriately.Here are some examples to illustrate the first three of the take-home messages about endocrine disruption that I listed above. As for the fourth, I would point you to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Exposure Report for evidence of the widespread exposure to these chemicals.Regarding low dose: Early studies of EDCs in sensitive animal models established examples in which no threshold dose could be detected; that is, effects were already apparent at the lowest doses tested. Moreover, there are some endocrine disrupting chemicals whose effects can be seen at low doses but not at high doses, in opposition to the usual dose-response curve familiar to toxicologists, which shows continually increasing responses with increases in dose. A 2007 NIEHS-sponsored review of studies of in vivo effects of Bisphenol A (BPA), for example, identified evidence for effects of low dose exposure during development on subsequent brain structure, function and behavior in rats and mice.An NIEHS-funded group at the Dartmouth College Superfund Research Program discovered that arsenic can act as a potent endocrine disruptor. They have shown that arsenic profoundly affects the function of five steroid hormone receptors (the receptors for glucocorticoid, androgen, progesterone, mineralocorticoid, and estrogen hormones) as well as the function of related nuclear receptors for thyroid hormone and retinoic acid. These effects were observed at levels of 0.01 to 2.0 micromolars in cell culture and at or below 10 ppb in several animal models. They have also shown that arsenic has a significant effect on the ability of an activated hormone receptor to regulate gene expression, and that low level drinking water arsenic has strong, tissue-specific effects on expression of genes and proteins involved in the innate immune response in mouse lung. They found that mice that were exposed to 100 ppb arsenic in drinking water had a significantly compromised response to H1N1 influenza infection.Regarding the broad range of effects: As our understanding of mechanisms has grown, so has our recognition of the many ways these compounds interact with the body and the many health outcomes that are influenced. The early work on endocrine disruption started out focusing mostly on outcomes that were known to be sensitive to the effects of steroid hormones, such as cancers of the reproductive system, and on mechanisms that involved hormonal receptors located in the cells’ nuclei. However, in addition to working through normal nuclear hormone receptors such as estrogen, androgen, thyroid, and retinoid receptors, we find that these molecules interact with many other kinds of receptors, such as membrane (non-nuclear) receptors, neurotransmitter receptors, enzymatic pathways involved in steroid biosynthesis and metabolism, and all the other mechanisms that enable hormone systems to do the work they need to do, which in turn enables the organism to function normally and react to changes. So the universe of potential health effects has grown commensurately to include non-reproductive cancers, immune effects, metabolic effects, and brain development and behavior, in addition to non-cancer abnormalities of the reproductive system, such as reproductive tract abnormalities, precocious puberty, disorders of fertility and fecundity, and endometriosis. For example, endocrine control of glucose homeostasis can impact development of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Researchers have now identified model systems and mechanisms by which developmental exposure to EDCs such as tributyltin , genistein and diethylstilbestrol may potentially cause weight gain in animals later in life. NIEHS-funded researchers are working on understanding biochemical and physiological aspects of environmental contributions to obesity, and we expect this work to have an impact on the development of interventions and preventive strategies to deal with this huge public health issue.There are concerns about multiple possible health effects of BPA exposure. BPA is a selective endocrine modulator with widespread human exposure. The Department’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced that it has some concern about the potential effects of BPA, partly based on the conclusions of the NTP-CERHR Monograph on Potential Human Reproductive and Developmental Effects of Bisphenol A (see summary ), which in turn built on the earlier consensus statement report from the expert panel workshop convened by the NIEHS . While much of the exposure to BPA in humans occurs through the diet, other sources of exposure include air, dust, and water. NIEHS invested approximately $20M in FY2009 to study health effects of BPA exposure, including $10.7M from ARRA funding. We have developed a program to assess differences in routes of exposure and metabolism across species, as well as the replication and expansion of experiments that linked BPA exposure to disease endpoints such as cancers, ADHD, obesity/diabetes/metabolic syndrome, immune dysfunction, reproductive diseases and dyfunctions, and cardiovascular disease. In addition, an NTP study is being conducted with FDA measuring the effects of long term exposures to a wide dose range of BPA in rats.Regarding persistence of biological effects: Because of the existence of special windows of susceptibility in developmental processes, we know that exposure to EDCs at very sensitive stages of development can result in profound changes in physiology and function that may not emerge clinically until much later in life. The exposure itself may cease, but the developmental impact and the subsequent adverse effect have already been set in motion. NIEHS leads the cross-NIH effort to understand how exposure-related changes in an individual’s epigenetic status in one stage of their life can affect the health of the individual in later stages of their lifespan. Epigenetics is one recently discovered mechanism by which EDCs can produce these latent effects by altering the three dimensional structure of the chromosomes. The addition of methyl groups to DNA and changes to the histone proteins in chromosomes alter gene expression, leading to effects that can persist not just through one lifetime, but potentially for generations.These delayed effects are the subject of a number of human studies funded by NIEHS. A group of researchers at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine recently reported that adverse behaviors of children aged 4-9 years (conduct or ADHD disorders) were associated with prenatal exposure to low molecular weight phthalates. Other scientists at Columbia University’s Center for Children’s Environmental Health (co-funded by NIEHS and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)) examined cord blood exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are ubiquitous flame retardants, and associations with neurodevelopment at ages 1-4 and 6 years. Children with higher concentrations of specific PBDEs while in utero scored lower on tests of mental and physical development. Previous data linking these compounds to altered thyroid hormones and thyroid function might provide a plausible mechanism for these effects.The NIEHS Breast Cancer and Environment Research Program (co-funded with the NIH’s National Cancer Institute) is investigating whether periods of susceptibility exist in the development of the mammary gland, when exposures to environmental agents may impact the breast and endocrine systems that can influence breast cancer risk in adulthood. It is examining the determinants of puberty in girls, integrating environmental, genetic, biologic, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors, in recognition of the epidemiology linking breast cancer risk to pubertal maturation. A major area of study is the role of exposures to EDCs. Center scientists have measured 51 environmental agents and their metabolites in biospecimens from approximately 1,190 girls. The data include the first report in children of high levels of a number of hormonally active chemicals such as enterolactone, benzophenone-3, and monoethyl-phthalate.A separate follow-up study is now in progress in response to observations of high perfluoroalkyl compound (PFC) levels measured in a geographically distinct subset of the Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Center cohort. PFCs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are of concern because of their presence in air, food, drinking water and human tissues, their persistence and long half-life, and their adverse effects on development in animal models. NIEHS is supporting numerous studies on these compounds. One of our intramural investigators is following up previous observations of an association between PFOS and PFOA and increased time-to-pregnancy (a measure of decreased fecundability). At the request of the EPA, the NTP initiated a large research program on this class of compounds that includes PFOS, PFOA and shorter and longer chain perfluoroalkyl compounds. These studies include an evaluation of multiple aspects of post-natal development following exposure in utero and will provide a sound basis for assessing cumulative human health risks for these ubiquitous contaminants.New science to promote new understanding: Given our growing understanding of the myriad of cellular hormonal targets of EDCs, new approaches have to be developed in order to characterize the potential for environmental agents to perturb endocrine function. NTP’s high throughput screening initiative (HTS) and Tox21 partnership, in collaboration with EPA and the NIH Chemical Genomics Center, include multiple assays designed to assess activity of chemicals at hormonal targets. Initial results have shown that among the most active of hundreds of chemicals tested so far in these assay systems is BPA. Triclosan, an antimicrobial in hand soaps, toothpaste, cosmetics, and many other products, and one of the most frequently detected water contaminants, also exhibits endocrine activity in these tests and is one of the most active compounds across multiple assays.By linking pre-existing and newly developed information on toxicological activity in whole animal studies of compounds registering as positive in these endocrine-relevant assays, we are able to explore the in vivo significance of signals picked up in HTS. As we move forward and develop and include additional assays for endocrine activity, HTS will help us decide which chemicals need further investigation.The NTP is employing in vitro and short term animal models to detect perturbations in endocrine function that can be used as a basis for deciding whether to conduct more rigorous long-term studies. Short term models are also being used to address questions of cumulative risk, that is, whether exposure to mixtures of similar compounds causes additive or synergistic (whole greater than the sum of the parts) effects. For example, through a collaborative arrangement with EPA’s Office of Research and Development, the NTP is conducting studies to evaluate effects on male reproductive endpoints for many combinations of phthalates to allow more precise comparisons of potency and a better understanding of cumulative risk for this class of compounds found in many plastics.The NTP is also planning new research relevant specifically to EDCs in drinking water. One set of studies will investigate the potential for mixtures of chemicals known to occur in drinking water to impact pre- and early post-natal development. These studies will focus on structurally dissimilar drugs and other industrial chemicals that perturb a common biological pathway, e.g. cholesterol and lipid metabolism.New information on endocrine activity has led the NTP to develop toxicological research programs on additional compounds such as bisphenol AF, used to make certain industrial polymers; butylparaben, a preservative used in cosmetics; oxybenzone, a sunscreen ingredient; and triclosan. The relevance of cosmetics, sunscreens and other personal care products to drinking water exposures has previously been highlighted. Endocrine activity is also of potential concern for herbal products taken as dietary supplements. NTP research programs on several of these, such as gum guggul, Dong quai, and valerian, includes evaluations of hormonal activity.In addition to generating new knowledge, we also need to make sure our science is shared with those who need to use it. This includes other Federal, state and local agencies as well as communities and individuals. Many of our research efforts are done in partnership with the agencies who will be the consumers of the research. We have also supported some excellent scientific forums for sharing this information with government and non-government scientists. For example, the NIEHS/NTP, along with other NIH components, FDA, CDC, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, EPA, the Society of Toxicology, the World Health Organization, and the European Environment Agency, recently sponsored a workshop on prenatal programming and toxicology entitled, “PPTOXII: Role of environmental stressors in the developmental origins of disease.” The meeting, attended by 280 scientists, focused on the developmental origins of disease with the goal of stimulating collaborations in the area of effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals on developmental toxicity. We are also mindful of the need to keep dialog open with affected communities. In our Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Program, researchers have created public messages to convey information about endocrine disrupting chemicals and their potential role in the prevention and understanding of breast cancer, including fact sheets for clinicians and the public on likely sources of exposures.In conclusion, let me stress that I believe this area of environmental health sciences to be of the utmost importance. Our endocrine systems keep our bodies in balance, maintaining homeostasis and guiding proper growth and development. With NIEHS’s leadership, we are learning more and more about how these finely tuned systems are sensitive to unanticipated effects from chemical exposures. This information is critically important for creating effective strategies to prevent disease and promote better health, as well as to ensure safe drinking water.Thank you for the opportunity to present information on this important topic. I would be happy to answer your questions.\nLast revised: June 18, 2013\n","Followers":"","title_name":"Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Drinking Water: Risks to Human Health and the Environment","ShareThis":"","comments":null,"authorName":"Linda S Birnbaum","score":0.0,"Fb_Votes":"","Date":"","Fb_Link":"","authors_info":"http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2010/02/t20100225a.html","Pinterest_Counts":"","Links":"http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2010/02/t20100225a.html","type":"blog","Twitter":"","Share":"Thursday February 25, 2010","Linkedin":"","Comments_point_of_view(to_author)":""}
